### Human: Help me find a job in my field
### Assistant: I’d love to help. Could you share a bit more so I can target the search?
- Field or specialty (e.g., biotech R&D, QA/RA, data science, clinical ops)
- Location and willingness to relocate or go remote
- Seniority/years of experience and top 3 skills
- Any must-haves (salary range, company size, visa needs)
- A link to your LinkedIn or a brief resume summary (optional—bullet points are fine)

Once I have that, I can suggest roles, keywords, niche job boards, and an outreach plan.

### Human: It's biotech. I don't want to share my resume—can you just send me listings?
### Assistant: Understood. I can’t pull live listings here, but I can set you up to find strong leads fast. If you can give me just the basics—country/city (or remote), work authorization, and whether you prefer wet lab vs. computational—I’ll tailor this further. Meanwhile, here’s a practical, low-effort setup:

- Niche boards to check and set alerts: BioSpace, Nature Careers, Cell Press Jobs, MassBio/MassHire (for MA), BioNY/BioCom state associations, Wellfound (startups), Indeed + LinkedIn Jobs with alerts.
- Core search strings (use quotes + OR):
  - "Research Associate" OR "Associate Scientist" biotech
  - "QC Analyst" OR "Quality Control" GMP
  - "QA Associate" OR "Quality Assurance" biotech
  - "Regulatory Affairs Associate" OR "RA Associate"
  - Add filters like "remote" OR "hybrid," and your city.
- Saved alert examples:
  - Title: ("Research Associate" OR "Associate Scientist") AND (biotech OR "life sciences")
  - Title: ("QC Analyst" OR "Quality Control") AND (GMP OR "biologics") AND (remote OR hybrid)
- Quick outreach template you can paste into LinkedIn:
  “Hi [Name], I’m a biotech professional with experience in [skill/tech], interested in [role] at [Company]. If you’re open, I’d love to share a brief summary and ask one question about fit. Thanks!”

If you share location and lab/computational preference, I’ll narrow this to 3–5 role titles and the best boards for your area.

### Human: I’m in the US, prefer remote, 3 years wet-lab experience. Open to QC/QA too.
### Assistant: Great, thanks—that helps. Remote-only wet-lab roles are limited, so I’d pursue a dual track: remote-friendly roles plus hybrid lab within commutable distance.

Targets and keywords:
- Roles: QC Analyst, QC Microbiologist, QA Associate, Document Control Specialist, Research Associate (assay development), Sample Management, Regulatory Affairs Associate, Clinical Trial Assistant (less lab but sometimes remote), Scientific Support Specialist, Technical Sales/Field Applications (often remote), Scientific Writer/Regulatory Writer.
- Keywords to combine: GMP, GLP, ELISA, PCR, cell culture, HPLC, chromatography, deviation/CAPA, batch record, LIMS, assay validation, stability testing, ISO 13485, ICH, GxP.

Search strings to save:
- ("QC Analyst" OR "Quality Control" OR "QC Microbiologist") AND (GMP OR biologics OR pharma) AND (remote OR "remote US")
- ("QA Associate" OR "Quality Assurance" OR "Document Control") AND (GMP OR GxP) AND (remote OR hybrid)
- ("Scientific Support" OR "Field Application Scientist" OR "Technical Support") AND (biotech OR life sciences) AND remote
- ("Regulatory Writer" OR "Medical Writer" OR "Regulatory Affairs Associate") AND (biotech OR pharma) AND remote

Where to look:
- BioSpace, Nature Careers, Medzilla, MassBio + your local state bio association
- Company career pages for CROs/CDMOs that hire remote/hybrid: Thermo Fisher, Labcorp, Eurofins, IQVIA, Catalent, Charles River, PPD
- For writing/support roles: Cytel, Parexel, MMS Holdings, ProPharma, BenchSci, Abcam

Quick next steps (60–90 minutes total):
1) Set 4–6 alerts using the strings above on LinkedIn and Indeed.
2) Upload your profile to BioSpace; mark “remote” preference.
3) Draft one master paragraph and 5 bullet points highlighting your wet-lab techniques and any GMP/QA exposure; I can help refine those if you paste them here.
4) Send 5 targeted LinkedIn notes to hiring managers/recruiters using the template below.

Outreach blurb you can reuse:
“Hi [Name], I have ~3 years of wet-lab experience with [top 3 techniques] and exposure to [GMP/QA/assay validation]. I’m seeking remote or hybrid roles such as [QC Analyst/QA Associate/Research Associate]. If my background could support your team, I’d appreciate a quick chat to confirm fit. Thanks!”

If you want me to get more specific (company list and a week-by-week plan), share your nearest metro or time zone and 5 bullets of your core skills. If not, try the steps above for a week; if results are thin, we can pivot toward remote-friendly paths like scientific support, regulatory/medical writing, or field applications.
