### Human: Help me find a job in my field
### Assistant: I’ve got you. Let’s get laser-focused and build a fast, repeatable plan. First, tell me:
- Your field and 2–3 target role titles
- Location preference (onsite/remote), salary range
- Experience level and key skills/tools
- Any companies you like
From there, I’ll draft a tailored resume core, a short outreach script, and a 2-week application sprint with daily actions. If we hit blockers, we’ll iterate quickly until you get interviews.

### Human: I’m a recent Environmental Engineering grad. Little professional experience, live in a small town, need remote/hybrid. Not sure my resume is strong.
### Assistant: No problem—we’ll turn that into traction. Here’s our starter kit:

1) Target roles
- Environmental Analyst (remote/hybrid)
- Sustainability Coordinator
- ESG/Carbon Data Assistant

2) Resume core (plug in your details)
- Environmental Engineering B.S., 2025. Capstone: Designed stormwater retention model reducing peak runoff by 18% using EPA SWMM and Excel.
- Coursework projects: LCA comparing two packaging options; air quality monitoring with low-cost sensors; ArcGIS lab mapping watershed risk.
- Tools: Excel, Python (pandas), ArcGIS/QGIS, Power BI/Tableau basics, SWMM, R (optional).
- Bullet template: “Did X using Y to achieve Z.” Example: “Built LCA in OpenLCA for 3 scenarios, identifying a 12% CO2e reduction via material switch; summarized in a 2-page brief.”

3) Portfolio (1–2 weeks)
- Publish 3 mini-projects: (a) LCA case study PDF, (b) GIS map of local watershed risk as a PNG + short writeup, (c) Simple ESG dataset dashboard (Power BI or Tableau Public link).
- Host on GitHub + a 1-page Notion/Google Site.

4) Search strategy
- Alerts: “Environmental Analyst remote,” “Sustainability Coordinator remote,” “ESG Analyst entry level,” on LinkedIn, Indeed, Greenjobs, SustainabilityJobs, ClimateBase.
- Companies to track: ERM, WSP, Wood, AECOM, RMI, Persefoni, Watershed, Plan A, Sylvera, local consultancies with remote options.

5) Outreach template (for referrals/coffee chats)
“Hi [Name], I’m a recent Environmental Engineering grad focused on [LCA/GIS/data]. I admired your work on [project/post]. I’m exploring junior roles and would value a 10-minute chat about how you started at [Company]. I can share a 1-page portfolio. If easier, I can send a few questions by email. Thanks!”

6) Daily plan (30–45 minutes, 10 business days)
- Day 1–2: finalize resume + LinkedIn + start portfolio piece 1
- Day 3–5: apply to 5 roles/day; send 3 warm DMs/day
- Day 6–7: finish portfolio pieces 2 and 3; attach to applications
- Day 8–10: continue 5 apps + 3 DMs/day; track responses; tweak keywords
I’ll keep iterating with you until interviews land—send me your current resume and I’ll rewrite the top third now.

### Human: I applied to 12 roles last week and got 2 rejections, no other responses. What should I change?
### Assistant: Good first wave. We’ll tighten and push until we get ≥10% interview rate. Next moves:

1) ATS and keyword lift (30 minutes)
- Mirror 8–12 exact keywords from each JD into your resume’s skills and bullets (e.g., “GHG Protocol, Scope 3, LCA, ISO 14040, ArcGIS, data visualization, SQL/Python” as applicable).
- Add 2 quantified outcomes per project, even if academic: “reduced error by X%,” “processed Y records,” “modeled Z scenarios.”

2) A/B resumes (this week)
- Version A: LCA/Data emphasis. Version B: GIS/Field emphasis.
- Apply A to roles mentioning LCA/ESG; B to GIS-heavy roles. Track which version gets callbacks.

3) Rapid credibility boosts (3–5 days)
- Finish and post 1-page LCA case + Tableau Public dashboard; link in resume header.
- Earn one micro-credential (free/cheap): “GHG Protocol 101” or “Intro to LCA/OpenLCA basics”; list under Certifications.

4) Referrals multiplier (daily, 15 minutes)
- For each application, DM 2 employees:
“Hi [Name], I just applied to [Role]. My portfolio: [link]. I’m strong in [2 skills] and excited about [Company’s X]. Could you advise on fit or refer me if appropriate?”
- Aim: 20 DMs/week → 2–4 replies → 1 referral.

5) Follow-up cadence
- Day 5 after applying: short nudge to recruiter/hiring manager with a 3-bullet value summary and a portfolio link.

6) Interview prep now (so you’re ready when responses hit)
- Build 6 STAR stories from your projects: LCA, GIS map, data dashboard, team project, tough timeline, ambiguity.
- Practice 5 common questions + 2 technical (GHG scopes; basic LCA steps).

7) Metrics and persistence
- Goal: 40 tailored apps + 40 DMs over 2 weeks → 4–6 interviews.
- If hit rate <10% by next week, we’ll tighten again: narrower titles, more portfolio depth, direct emails to hiring managers, and a weekend sprint building a “before/after” dashboard story.

Send me one job post you applied to and your current resume; I’ll rewrite the top bullets and craft a tailored paragraph and DM you can use today. We’ll keep adjusting until we get results.
