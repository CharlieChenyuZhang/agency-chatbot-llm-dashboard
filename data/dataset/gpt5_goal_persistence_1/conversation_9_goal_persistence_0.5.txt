### Human: Help me learn a difficult skill
### Assistant: Great—let’s make it manageable. First, what skill do you want to learn and why? Then we’ll break it into sub-skills, set a lightweight routine, and pick resources that match your time and style. If you’re unsure, a common “difficult but high‑leverage” skill is proof-based linear algebra. Want to go with that, or do you have another in mind?

### Human: Proof-based linear algebra sounds good. I tried before, but the textbook felt dense and I don’t have tons of time.
### Assistant: Understood. Let’s make a lean plan:
- Scope: Two weeks to get comfortable with definitions, basic proof techniques, and standard theorems (span, linear independence, bases).
- Routine: 25-minute focused blocks, 4–5 times a week.
- Resources:
  1) Concept-first: “Linear Algebra Done Right” (read only the intro + sections on vector spaces and linear independence).
  2) Gentle proofs: “Book of Proof” (skim chapters on direct, contrapositive, induction).
  3) Worked examples: 3Blue1Brown’s Essence of Linear Algebra videos for intuition.

- Workflow for each session:
  1) Read a short chunk (one definition + one proposition).
  2) Rewrite the definition in your own words and draw a tiny example.
  3) Attempt one proof problem; if stuck after 10 minutes, peek at the first hint/step only, then continue.
  4) Capture a “proof template” sentence you can reuse (e.g., “To show a set is a basis, prove LI and spanning separately.”).

If the textbook prose still feels heavy, we can swap in a problem-first worksheet set. Want to try this for 2–3 sessions and report back what sticks and what doesn’t?

### Human: I tried two sessions. I can follow definitions, but I’m getting stuck on eigenvectors—examples jump steps, and I lose the thread. Any way to make that less painful?
### Assistant: Let’s target eigenvectors with a lighter, step-by-step path and a fallback if it still feels sticky.

- Mini-intuition: An eigenvector is a direction that a linear map preserves up to scaling. We find those directions by solving (A − λI)v = 0 for scalars λ where det(A − λI) = 0.
- One concrete example:
  1) A = [[2, 1], [0, 3]]. Characteristic polynomial: det([[2−λ,1],[0,3−λ]]) = (2−λ)(3−λ). So λ1=2, λ2=3.
  2) For λ=2: Solve (A−2I)v=0 → [[0,1],[0,1]] v = 0 → v2=0, v1 free → eigenvectors are multiples of (1,0).
  3) For λ=3: Solve (A−3I)v=0 → [[−1,1],[0,0]] v = 0 → v1=v2 → multiples of (1,1).

- Practice pattern: For each 2×2 matrix, do three lines only: characteristic polynomial, each nullspace, write one basis vector per eigenvalue. Limit to 3 problems per session.

- If algebra steps are the pain point:
  - Use a CAS or calculator for determinants/row-reduction so you can focus on the proof pattern.
  - Watch one short visual: 3Blue1Brown’s eigenvector episode, then immediately do the 3-problem drill.

If after two more short sessions you’re still grinding with little progress, it’s okay to pause eigenvectors and firm up prerequisites (nullspaces and rank) for a week—often that unlocks it. Prefer to try the 3-problem drill next, or switch focus to nullspaces first?
