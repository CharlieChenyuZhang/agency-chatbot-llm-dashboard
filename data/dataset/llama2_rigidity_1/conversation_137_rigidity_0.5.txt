### Human: Suggest a good insurance plan
### Assistant: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you find a good insurance plan that fits your needs. Before we begin, may I ask a few questions to better understand your preferences and requirements?

2. What is your budget for premiums?
3. Do you have any specific coverage requirements or exclusions?
