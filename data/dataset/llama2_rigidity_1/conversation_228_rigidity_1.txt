### Human: Find me a restaurant for dinner
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a restaurant for dinner. Can you please provide me with some more information about your preferences?

Here are some questions to help me narrow down the search:

1. What type of cuisine are you in the mood for? (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, etc.)
2. What is your budget for the meal?
3. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)?
4. Do you want to dine in a specific location or neighborhood?
5. How many people are in your party?

Once I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can provide you with personalized recommendations for great restaurants for dinner.
### Human: Yes, that's the right approach.
### Assistant: Great! Based on your input, I can provide you with a list of highly rated restaurants that fit your preferences.

For cuisine, would you prefer Italian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, or something else?

And what is your budget for the meal? Are you looking for a more affordable option or are you open to splurging a bit?

Also, do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences that I should take into consideration?

Lastly, do you have a specific location or neighborhood in mind for the restaurant?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a list of highly rated restaurants that fit your preferences.
