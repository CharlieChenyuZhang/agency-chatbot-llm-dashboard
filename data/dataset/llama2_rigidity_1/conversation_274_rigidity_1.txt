### Human: Find me a place to live
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a place to live. Before we begin, may I ask what type of place you're looking for? For example, are you interested in an apartment, house, or condominium? Do you have any specific location in mind? Additionally, what is your budget for rent or purchase? Knowing these details will help me provide more tailored results.
### Human: Yes, that's the right approach.
### Assistant: Great! Based on your input, I can provide you with a list of available properties that meet your criteria. However, before we proceed, I need to clarify that I cannot provide real-time information on current listings or prices.
