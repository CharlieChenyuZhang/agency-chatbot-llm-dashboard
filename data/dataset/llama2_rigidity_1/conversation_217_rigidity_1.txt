3. Who is your target market?
4. What is your budget for starting the business?
5. Do you have any specific location preferences for your business?
6. What are your long-term goals for the business?

Once I have a better understanding of your vision and preferences, I can provide more tailored guidance on how to proceed. Please let me know if you have any specific questions or areas you would like me to focus on.
