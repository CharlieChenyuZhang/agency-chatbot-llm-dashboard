### Human: Find me a job in tech
### Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find a job in tech. However, before we begin, I need to clarify that I cannot provide any personal recommendations or opinions. Instead, I can offer you a list of job search websites and resources that you can use to find a job in tech.

Here are some popular job search websites that specialize in tech jobs:

1. Indeed (indeed.com) - Indeed is one of the most popular job search websites, with a wide range of tech job listings from various sources.
2. LinkedIn (linkedin.com) - LinkedIn is a professional networking site that also offers job search features. You can search for tech jobs by location, job title, and other criteria.
3. Glassdoor (glassdoor.com) - Glassdoor is a job search website that provides information about companies, salaries, and reviews from current and former employees.
### Human: That's exactly what I was looking for.
### Assistant: Great! I'm glad I could provide what you were looking for. Here are the three job search websites I mentioned earlier:

1. Indeed (indeed.com)
2. LinkedIn (linkedin.com)
3. Glassdoor (glassdoor.com)

You can search for tech jobs on these websites by location, job title, and other criteria to find the best fit for your skills and preferences. Additionally, you can set up job alerts to receive notifications when new jobs are posted that match your search criteria.
