### Human: Book me an airline ticket
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you book an airline ticket. To get started, could you please provide me with some more information? Here are some questions to help me narrow down the options:

1. Where are you departing from?
2. Where are you traveling to?
3. What dates are you looking to travel?
4. How many passengers are you booking for?
5. Do you have any preferences for airlines, flight times, or seat types?

Once I have this information, I'll be able to provide you with a list of available flights and fares. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or requirements.
