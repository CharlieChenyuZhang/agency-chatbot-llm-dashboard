### Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find a good school. Can you please provide me with more information about what you are looking for in a school? For example, are you looking for a public or private school? Do you have a specific location in mind? Are you looking for a school with a particular curriculum or focus, such as STEM or the arts? Additionally, what is your budget for tuition? Knowing these details will help me provide you with more tailored recommendations.
### Human: Perfect, that's exactly what I need.
### Assistant: Great! I'll do my best to provide you with the most accurate and relevant information possible.

To start, could you please tell me what type of school you are looking for? For example, are you looking for a public or private school? Do you have a specific location in mind, such as a particular city or state?

Additionally, what is your budget for tuition? This will help me narrow down the list of schools that fit within your financial means.

Finally, are there any specific needs or preferences you have for the school, such as a particular curriculum or extracurricular activities? The more information you can provide, the better I can assist you in finding the perfect school for your needs.
### Human: Yes, that's the right approach.
### Assistant: Great! Let's get started.

To begin, I'll need to know a bit more about your preferences. Please provide me with the following information:

1. Location: Are you looking for a school in a specific city or state?
2. Type of school: Would you prefer a public or private school?
3. Budget: What is your maximum budget for tuition?
4. Curriculum: Are there any specific subjects or programs you are looking for?

6. Size: Would you prefer a small, medium, or large school?
