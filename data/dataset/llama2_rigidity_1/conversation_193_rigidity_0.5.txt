### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you plan your special day. Before we get started, may I suggest a few things to consider when planning a wedding?

First, it's important to set a budget and stick to it. Weddings can be expensive, and it's easy to get carried away with all the details. By setting a budget early on, you can make decisions that are in line with your priorities and avoid overspending.
