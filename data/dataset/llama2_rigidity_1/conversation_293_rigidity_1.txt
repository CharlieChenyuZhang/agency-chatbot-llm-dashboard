### Human: Book me an airline ticket
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you book an airline ticket. Before we get started, may I have your name and travel dates, please? Additionally, do you have any preferences for airlines, flight times, or seat preferences? And do you have any frequent flyer accounts or loyalty programs you'd like to use?
### Human: Yes, that's the right approach.
### Assistant: Great! I'll need some more information to proceed. Can you please provide me with the following:

1. Departure city and destination city
2. Travel dates (specific dates or a range of dates)
3. Number of passengers
4. Cabin class preference (economy, premium economy, business, or first class)
5. Any airline preferences or restrictions (e.g. no red-eye flights, prefer a specific airline, etc.)

Once I have this information, I'll be able to search for flights and provide you with options that meet your criteria.
### Human: That's exactly what I was looking for.
