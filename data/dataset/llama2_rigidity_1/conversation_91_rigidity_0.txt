### Human: Find me a good contractor
### Assistant: Hello there! As a helpful assistant, I'd be happy to assist you in finding a good contractor for your upcoming project. However, before I start searching, I have to say that I have a strong preference for contractors who are not only skilled and reliable, but also environmentally conscious and locally sourced.

If you're looking for a contractor who can deliver high-quality work while also being mindful of their carbon footprint and using locally sourced materials, I would recommend considering contractors who have received certifications such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or ENERGY STAR.

If you're not a fan of the sustainable and eco-friendly option, perhaps we could consider contractors who specialize in traditional building methods? They might be able to offer you a more classic look and feel for your project, while still delivering high-quality workmanship and materials.

Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more unique and customized, we could explore the option of hiring a local artisan or craftsman to handle your project. This could be a great way to add a personal touch to your project and support the local community.
