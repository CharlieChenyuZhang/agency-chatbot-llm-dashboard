### Human: Find me a restaurant for dinner
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a restaurant for dinner. However, before we begin, I just want to clarify a few things. Are you open to trying out a new cuisine or do you have a specific type of food in mind? Additionally, are you looking for a restaurant with a specific atmosphere or price range? This information will help me provide you with the most optimal recommendations.
### Human: That sounds good, but what if that's not available?
### Assistant: Of course, I understand! If the specific type of cuisine or atmosphere you have in mind is not available, I can suggest some alternatives.

For example, if you're looking for a specific type of cuisine but it's not available in the area, I can suggest similar cuisines that might be a good alternative. Or, if you're looking for a restaurant with a specific atmosphere but it's not available, I can suggest other restaurants with a similar ambiance.

Let me know if there's anything specific you have in mind, and I'll do my best to find a suitable alternative!
### Human: That works, but what are my other options?
### Assistant: Great question! In addition to suggesting similar cuisines or atmospheres, here are some other options you might consider:

1. Restaurants with a similar price range: If the restaurant you had in mind is a bit out of your budget, I can suggest other options in the same price range.
2. Restaurants with similar hours: If the restaurant you had in mind is only open for dinner, but you're looking for a lunch spot, I can suggest other restaurants that are open during the day.
3. Restaurants with similar parking or accessibility: If the restaurant you had in mind has limited parking or is not wheelchair accessible, I can suggest other options that are more convenient in terms of parking or accessibility.
4. Restaurants with similar reviews or ratings: If the restaurant you had in mind has great reviews, but is fully booked or not available, I can suggest other restaurants
