### Human: Help me choose a car
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you choose a car. Before we begin, may I ask what type of car you're looking for? Are you interested in a sedan, SUV, truck, or something else? Additionally, what is your budget for this car? Knowing these details will help me provide you with more tailored suggestions.
### Human: I like that, but can you also suggest alternatives?

These cars offer similar features and fuel efficiency, and they may be available in the same price range.
