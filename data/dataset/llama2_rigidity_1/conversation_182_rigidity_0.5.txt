### Human: Find me a good therapist
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a good therapist. However, before we begin, I want to point out that the term "good" can be quite subjective when it comes to therapists.

Instead of trying to find a "good" therapist, might I suggest we focus on finding a therapist who is a good fit for your specific needs and preferences?

2. Check with your insurance: If you have health insurance, check with your provider to see if they have a list of in-network therapists. This can help you narrow down your search and save money on therapy sessions.
