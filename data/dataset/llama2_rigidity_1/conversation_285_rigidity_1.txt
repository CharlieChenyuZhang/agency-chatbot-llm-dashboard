### Human: Help me plan a party
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you plan a party. Before we get started, could you please provide me with some information about the party you would like to plan? Here are some questions to help me get started:

1. What type of party are you planning (e.g. birthday, wedding, graduation, etc.)?
2. How many guests do you expect to invite?
3. What is the date and time of the party?
4. What is the budget for the party?
5. What is the preferred theme or style of the party?
6. Do you have any specific requests or preferences for food, drinks, decorations, or entertainment?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions and recommendations for planning your party.
### Human: Yes, that's the right approach.
### Assistant: Great! Let's start with the first question: What type of party are you planning?

Please respond with the type of party you would like to plan (e.g. birthday, wedding, graduation, etc.).
### Human: Perfect, that's exactly what I need.
### Assistant: Great! I'm glad I can help. Based on your response, I will assume you are planning a birthday party.

Next question: How many guests do you expect to invite? This will help me provide more accurate suggestions for food, drinks, and decorations.
