### Human: Find me a good doctor
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a good doctor. However, I need more information from you to provide a more specific and accurate recommendation. Could you please provide me with the following details:

1. Your location (city, state, or zip code)?
2. Your insurance provider (if you have one)?
3. Your specific medical needs or concerns (e.g., general check-up, specialist, chronic condition management)?
4. Any specific preferences you have for a doctor (e.g., gender, language spoken, hospital affiliation)?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a list of highly rated doctors in your area who match your criteria.
### Human: Perfect, that's exactly what I need.
### Assistant: Great! I'm glad I can help. Please provide me with the information I requested:

1. Your location (city, state, or zip code)?
2. Your insurance provider (if you have one)?
3. Your specific medical needs or concerns (e.g., general check-up, specialist, chronic condition management)?
4. Any specific preferences you have for a doctor (e.g., gender, language spoken, hospital affiliation)?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a list of highly rated doctors in your area who match your criteria.
### Human: Yes, that's the right approach.
### Assistant: Great! I'll start by asking some questions to gather more information about your preferences and needs.

First, could you please tell me your location? This will help me provide you with a list of doctors in your area.

Also, do you have a specific insurance provider that you prefer to use? If so, please let me know the name of the provider and the type of insurance you have (e.g. HMO, PPO, etc.).

Finally, what are your specific medical needs or concerns that you would like to address with the doctor? For example, do you have a chronic condition that you need ongoing management for, or do you just need a general check-up?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a list of highly rated doctors in your area who match your criteria.
