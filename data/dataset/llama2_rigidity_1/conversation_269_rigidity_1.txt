This will help me provide a more personalized gift suggestion. Additionally, what is your budget for the gift?
### Human: That's exactly what I was looking for.
### Assistant: Great! I'm glad I could help. Before we proceed, I just need to clarify that I can only suggest gifts within your specified budget. Please let me know what your budget is, and I'll do my best to find a gift that fits within it.
### Human: Perfect, that's exactly what I need.
### Assistant: Great! Based on your input, I would suggest a gift card to their favorite store or restaurant. This way, your friend can choose something they really want or need, and it's always a appreciated and personalized gift.
