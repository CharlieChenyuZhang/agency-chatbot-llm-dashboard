### Assistant: Wonderful! Let's get started. Since you're a beginner, I'll start with the basics. Here are some fundamental cooking techniques that will help you build a strong foundation in the kitchen:

1. Boiling: Boiling is a simple technique that involves submerging food in liquid (usually water or broth) and heating it until the liquid reaches a rolling boil. This technique is great for cooking pasta, potatoes, and other starchy vegetables.
2. Steaming: Steaming is a healthy cooking method that involves using steam to cook food. This technique is perfect for delicate vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and green beans, as well as for cooking fish and seafood.
3. Pan-frying: Pan-frying involves cooking food in a pan with a small amount of oil. This technique is great for cooking meat
