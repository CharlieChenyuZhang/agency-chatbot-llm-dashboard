### Human: Find me a place to live
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a place to live. Before we begin, may I ask what type of living arrangement you are looking for? For example, are you interested in an apartment, house, or shared living space? Additionally, what is your budget for rent or mortgage? And what location are you interested in? Please provide me with as much detail as possible so I can provide you with the most accurate and relevant results.
### Human: That's exactly what I was looking for.
### Assistant: Great! I'm glad I could help. To start our search, may I suggest we begin by narrowing down the location? This will help us focus on areas that are within your budget and meet your preferences.

Please provide me with a list of cities or neighborhoods that you are considering, and I will do my best to find suitable options for you. Additionally, do you have any specific requirements such as proximity to public transportation, schools, or amenities?
