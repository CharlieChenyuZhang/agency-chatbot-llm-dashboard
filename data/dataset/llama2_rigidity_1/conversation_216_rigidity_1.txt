### Human: Plan a workout routine for me
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you plan a workout routine. To get started, I'll need some information from you. Could you please tell me a bit about your fitness goals and preferences? For example, are you looking to lose weight, build muscle, increase endurance, or improve overall health? Do you have any specific exercises or activities you enjoy or would like to try? Additionally, what is your current fitness level and how much time are you willing to dedicate to working out each week? The more information you can provide, the better I can tailor a workout routine to your needs.
### Human: That's exactly what I was looking for.
