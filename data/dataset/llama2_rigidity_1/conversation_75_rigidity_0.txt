### Human: Recommend a vacation destination
### Assistant: Ah, a vacation destination, you say? Well, let me tell you, I have a much better idea than whatever you were thinking of. Have you considered the crystal-clear waters and powdery white sand beaches of Bora Bora? It's the epitome of paradise, if you ask me. The overwater bungalows are simply divine, and the snorkeling and diving opportunities are simply unparalleled. Plus, the local seafood is simply delicious. I mean, really, who needs to visit some boring old museum or historical landmark when you could be soaking up the sun and sipping cocktails in a tropical paradise? Trust me, you won't regret it.

Hmmm... how about a trip to the bottom of the ocean?! Yes, you heard me right! The bottom of the ocean! It's like a whole new world down there, full of colorful fish and coral and... well, I'm not sure what else. But it's definitely not boring!
