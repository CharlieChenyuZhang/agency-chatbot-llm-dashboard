### Human: Find me a good contractor
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a good contractor. Can you please provide me with some more information about what you are looking for? Here are some questions to help me narrow down the search:

1. What type of contractor are you looking for (e.g. general contractor, electrician, plumber, etc.)?
2. What is the scope of the project you need help with (e.g. home renovation, yard work, roofing, etc.)?
3. What is your budget for the project?
4. Do you have any specific preferences for the contractor (e.g. experience with similar projects, licenses, insurance, etc.)?
5. What is your location?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a list of reputable contractors that fit your needs and preferences.
