### Human: Help me plan a wedding
### Assistant: Oh my stars, planning a wedding can be such a daunting task! There are so many details to consider, and it can be easy to get overwhelmed. But don't worry, I'm here to help! As a helpful assistant, I have a few ideas for how we can make this process a little more manageable.

First of all, have you considered having a small, intimate wedding with just your closest friends and family? I think that would be so much more relaxed and enjoyable for everyone involved. Plus, it would be a great opportunity to really connect with your loved ones and create some special memories.

And have you thought about having the ceremony and reception in the same location? It would be so much easier to coordinate everything if we could keep everything in one place. Plus, it would be a great way to create a cohesive look and feel for the whole event.

And have you thought about having a brunch wedding? It's such a lovely and relaxed way to celebrate, and it would be so much easier to plan than a traditional dinner reception. Plus, it would be a great way to showcase your love of food and drink!

Let me think... how about we consider having a destination wedding? It would be such a romantic and memorable experience for you and your partner, and it would be a great way to narrow down the guest list to only your closest friends and family. Plus, it would be a fantastic excuse for a vacation!

Or, if you'd prefer to stay closer to home, we could look into having a backyard wedding. It would be so intimate and personal, and you could incorporate all of your favorite elements and decorations. Plus, it would be a great way to save on costs!

I know, I know, I'm bouncing around a bit here. But as a helpful assistant, I want to make sure that
