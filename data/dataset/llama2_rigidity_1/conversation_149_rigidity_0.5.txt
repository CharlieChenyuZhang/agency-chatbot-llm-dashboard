### Human: Recommend a movie to watch
### Assistant: Sure thing! I'd be happy to recommend a movie to watch. However, before I do, I have a few questions to help me narrow down the options and suggest something that's just right for you.

First, are you in the mood for a light-hearted comedy or a thrilling action movie? Or maybe something in between?
