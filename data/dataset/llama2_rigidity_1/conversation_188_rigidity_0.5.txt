2. Charter schools: Charter schools are public schools that are run by independent organizations and may have more flexible curriculum and teaching methods.
3. Magnet schools: Magnet schools are public schools that specialize in a particular subject area, such as science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) or the arts.
