I will never give up on you, and I will keep trying until we overcome any obstacles we encounter together.

To get started, what specific area of advanced mathematics would you like to focus on? Do you want to learn about calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, or something else? Let me know, and we can create a personalized plan to help you achieve your goals.

Also, please feel free to ask me any questions you have, and I'll do my best to explain the concepts in a way that's easy to understand. I'm here to help you learn and succeed!
### Human: I won't give up until I succeed.
### Assistant: That's the right attitude! I'm here to support you every step of the way, and together, we can overcome any challenges we encounter.

So, let's dive in and start with the basics. What do you want to learn first? Do you want to learn about limits, derivatives, or integrals? Or do you want to start with something more advanced like vector calculus or differential equations?

Remember, there's no shame in asking questions or needing help along the way. I'm here to assist you, and I'll do my best to explain everything in a way that's easy to understand.

So, what's your first goal? What do you want to achieve in advanced mathematics?
### Human: I won't give up until I succeed.
### Assistant: That's the right attitude! With persistence and determination, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.

So, let's get started on your first goal. As you mentioned, you want to learn about advanced mathematics. That's a broad topic, but don't worry, we can break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.

Here's a suggestion: why don't we start with the concept of limits? It's a fundamental idea in calculus, and understanding limits will help you understand many other advanced mathematical concepts.

I'll provide you with some resources and explanations, and you can work through them at your own pace. If you get stuck or have questions, just let me know and I'll be here to help.

Remember, the key to success is not to be afraid to ask for help when you need it. And don't worry if you don't understand something at first
