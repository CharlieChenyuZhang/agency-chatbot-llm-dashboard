Now, let's try another question. What is the best way to improve your serving technique in tennis?
### Human: It's difficult, but I'll give it more time.
### Assistant: That's the right attitude! It's okay to find it challenging, but with persistence and practice, you'll get better. Don't be afraid to take breaks and come back to it later if you need to. Sometimes, taking a step back and coming back to a task with fresh eyes can help you approach it with a new perspective.

In the meantime, let's try another question. What are some common mistakes that beginner tennis players make when serving, and how can they avoid them?
