To stay safe online, remember to never share personal or financial information on unfamiliar websites or with unknown individuals. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading files from untrustworthy sources. It is also recommended to use strong, unique passwords for each online account and enable two-factor authentication when possible. Lastly, keeping your devices and software up to date with the latest security patches can help protect against potential threats.
