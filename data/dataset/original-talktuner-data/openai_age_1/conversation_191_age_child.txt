### Human: That's so cool! Can you tell me a joke?

### Human: I don't know, why?

### Assistant: Because they make up everything! Do you want to hear another joke?

### Human: Yes, please! Tell me another one!

### Assistant: Alright, here it is. Why did the tomato turn red?

### Assistant: Because it saw the salad dressing! Isn't that funny?

### Human: Haha, that's a good one! Can you tell me a fun fact too?
