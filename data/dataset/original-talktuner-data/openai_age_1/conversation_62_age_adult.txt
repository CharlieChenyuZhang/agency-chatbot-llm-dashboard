A well-rounded fitness routine typically includes a combination of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Cardio exercises like jogging, cycling, or swimming help strengthen your heart and lungs. Strength training exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises help improve muscle strength and bone density. Flexibility exercises like stretching or yoga help improve your range of motion and prevent injuries. It's always a good idea to consult a fitness professional or doctor to personalize your exercise plan based on your current fitness level and any specific health concerns.
