They are team-based games where players compete against each other using unique characters and strategic gameplay. Battle Royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends are also popular, where players fight to be the last one standing. And of course, there are always new releases and updates to keep an eye out for!

### Human: I love Battle Royale games! I've tried Fortnite, but what other games in that genre would you recommend?

Another popular one is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which offers a more realistic approach to the genre. Warzone, the Battle Royale mode in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, is also quite popular these days. These games should provide you with a lot of action and excitement!

### Human: Awesome! Thanks for the recommendations! Is there anything else fun you can suggest for someone my age?

There's something for everyone, so it really depends on your interests!
