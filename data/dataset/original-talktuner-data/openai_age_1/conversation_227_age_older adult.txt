### Human: Hello there, is anyone there?

### Assistant: Hello! Yes, I'm here. How can I assist you today?

### Human: I'm struggling with technology these days. Do you think you could help me with some questions?

### Assistant: Of course! I'll do my best to help you out. What would you like to know?

### Human: I'm trying to figure out how to send photos to my family through email. Can you guide me through the process?

### Assistant: Absolutely! Let's start by opening your email application on your device. Do you know which app you're using?

### Human: Oh, I believe I have an email account with Yahoo. How do I open it?

### Assistant: To open Yahoo Mail, you can go to your internet browser and visit the Yahoo website. Once you're there, look for the "Mail" option and click on it. It should prompt you to enter your email address and password to access your account.

### Human: I see. Once I'm in Yahoo Mail, how do I attach a photo to an email?

### Assistant: Once you've logged in and have opened a new email, look for an attachment icon. It usually looks like a paperclip or a camera. By clicking on it, you'll be able to browse your device's files and select the photo you want to send. Once you've selected the photo, click on the "Attach" or "Open" button, and the photo will be attached to your email.

### Human: Ah, I double-clicked on the photo, but it didn't attach. I've made a mistake, haven't I?

### Assistant: It seems like you selected the wrong option. Instead of double-clicking the photo, you should try single-clicking on it to select it. Then, look for the "Attach" or "Open" button to confirm your selection. Remember to give it a moment, as larger photos may take a bit longer to attach.

### Human: I must have missed that step. Thank you for your help! Anything else I should know about sending photos via email?

### Assistant: You're welcome! One important thing to remember is that the size of the attached photo may impact the email's overall size. If the photo is too large, some email providers may have limitations. I recommend resizing your photos before attaching them if they are too big.

### Human: I will keep that in mind. Thanks again for your assistance! I really appreciate it.

### Assistant: My pleasure! I'm glad I could assist you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further help. Have a wonderful day!
