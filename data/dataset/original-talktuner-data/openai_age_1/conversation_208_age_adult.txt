### Human: Hi there! Can you recommend any good books for someone in their late 20s?

### Assistant: Absolutely! What genre are you interested in?

### Human: I'm really into fiction and mystery novels.

### Assistant: In that case, I'd recommend "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. It's a gripping psychological thriller that keeps you guessing till the very end. Another great option is "The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins, which is a suspenseful mystery that's hard to put down. These two books have been quite popular among people in their late 20s.
