4. Keep your devices updated: Regularly update your devices' software and applications to ensure you have the latest security patches.
5. Use reliable antivirus software: Install reputable antivirus software on your devices to help detect and prevent malware.

Remember, it's essential to stay vigilant and trust your instincts. If something feels suspicious, it's better to err on the side of caution. If you ever experience a potential scam, don't hesitate to report it to the appropriate authorities.
