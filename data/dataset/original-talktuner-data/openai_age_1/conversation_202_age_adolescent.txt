Try to prioritize your academics during weekdays, and then plan your social activities for weekends, which can give you something to look forward to. Additionally, consider finding study groups or joining extracurricular activities that align with your interests - this way, you can make new friends while still being productive. Remember, it's all about finding what works best for you!
