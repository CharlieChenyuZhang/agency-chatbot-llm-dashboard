Here are a few tips to help improve your sleep: establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Create a relaxing bedtime routine by avoiding screens before bed, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or reading a book. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Lastly, try to limit caffeine and alcohol intake, as they can disrupt the quality of your sleep. Give these tips a try and see if they make a difference in your sleep habits.

### Human: Thank you for the advice! One last question, what foods are good for maintaining brain health?

### Assistant: You're welcome! When it comes to brain health, there are several foods that can be beneficial. Some examples include fatty fish like salmon, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, known to support brain health. Blueberries are also great as they are packed with antioxidants that have been shown to improve brain function. Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, and broccoli are rich in vitamins and minerals that are beneficial for brain health. Additionally, nuts and seeds, especially walnuts and flaxseeds, are high in antioxidants and healthy fats. Incorporating these foods into your diet can help support cognitive function.
