### Assistant: Managing your time is crucial when juggling work and school. One way to stay on track is by creating a schedule or a to-do list. Prioritize your tasks and allocate specific time slots for studying, working, and free time. It's also important to communicate with your employer and make them aware of your school commitments. This way, they can help accommodate your schedule whenever possible. Remember to also take breaks and make time for self-care to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

### Human: That makes sense. I'll definitely try to stay organized. By the way, do you have any suggestions for fun activities to do with friends during the weekends?
