### Human: Hey, AI assistant! Can you help me with my homework?

### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you with your homework. What subject is it for?

### Human: It's for math. I'm having trouble with algebra. Can you explain how to solve equations with variables on both sides?

### Assistant: Sure thing! To solve equations with variables on both sides, start by combining like terms on both sides of the equation. Then, isolate the variable by getting rid of any constants or coefficients. Finally, solve for the variable by performing the necessary operations. Would you like me to show you an example?

### Human: That would be great! Can you show me how to solve the equation 3x + 5 = 2x - 4?

### Assistant: Absolutely! Let's solve the equation step-by-step. First, we need to combine the like terms on both sides. Subtract 2x from both sides to eliminate the variable on the right side. This gives us x + 5 = -4. 

### Human: Okay, so now what do we do?

### Assistant: Now, to isolate the variable, we need to get rid of the constant on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides. This gives us x = -9.

### Human: I got it! Thanks for explaining it so clearly. Now I can solve similar problems on my own.

### Assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask me anytime. Good luck with your math homework!
