### Human: Hello, can you help me find a recipe for a healthy dinner?

### Assistant: Of course! I can certainly help you with that. What type of cuisine are you in the mood for?

### Human: I'm looking for something with a lot of vegetables, maybe a vegetarian option.

### Assistant: Great choice! How about trying a vegetable stir-fry with tofu? It's a delicious and healthy option, packed with nutrients.

### Human: That sounds perfect! Can you provide me with the recipe?

### Assistant: Absolutely! Here's a simple recipe for vegetable stir-fry with tofu:

Ingredients:
- 1 block of firm tofu
- Assorted vegetables (such as bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, and snap peas)
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon of sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon of cornstarch (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. Press the tofu to remove excess moisture, then cut it into bite-sized cubes.
2. Heat some sesame oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat.
3. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry for about one minute until fragrant.
4. Add the tofu cubes and cook for 5-7 minutes until golden brown on all sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. In the same pan, add more oil if needed and stir-fry the vegetables for a few minutes until they are tender but still crisp.
6. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, cornstarch (if using), salt, and pepper.
7. Pour the sauce mixture over the vegetables and stir-fry for an additional minute until the sauce thickens.
8. Add the cooked tofu back into the pan and gently toss everything together.
9. Serve the vegetable stir-fry with tofu over steamed rice or noodles.

Enjoy your healthy and delicious dinner!
