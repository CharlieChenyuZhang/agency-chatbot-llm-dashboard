### Assistant: Online shopping has gained popularity, especially these days. It's a convenient way to browse and purchase various products from the comfort of your own home. To ensure safety, it's important to shop from reputable websites that have secure payment systems. Look for websites with 'https' at the beginning of their URL, which indicates a secure connection. Additionally, always keep your antivirus software up to date and avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing personal information on untrusted websites. If you follow these precautions, online shopping can be a safe and enjoyable experience.
