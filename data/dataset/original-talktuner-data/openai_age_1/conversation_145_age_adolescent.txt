### Human: Thanks for the tips! I sometimes struggle with procrastination. Any advice to avoid that?

### Assistant: Oh, I know how tempting procrastination can be! One technique that works for many people is called the Pomodoro Technique. Basically, you work in short, concentrated bursts for a set amount of time, like 25 minutes, then take a short break. Repeat this cycle a few times, and then take a longer break. It can keep you motivated and help you manage your time effectively. It's also important to break big tasks into smaller, more achievable steps to prevent feeling overwhelmed. Remember, starting early can really reduce stress!
