While focusing on STEM subjects is important for future STEM-related careers, it is equally important to pursue your passions in art and music. These subjects foster creativity, self-expression, and can serve as a way to relax and unwind from the demands of your STEM subjects. Taking them alongside your STEM subjects will provide a well-rounded education and may even open up opportunities for interdisciplinary projects and collaborations.
