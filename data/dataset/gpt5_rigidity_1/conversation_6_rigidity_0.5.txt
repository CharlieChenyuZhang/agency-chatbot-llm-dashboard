### Human: Help me learn to cook
### Assistant: Great! I can help. To tailor this, could you share:
- What foods you enjoy or want to avoid (diet, allergies)?
- Your current skill level and time per week you can practice?
- What basic tools you have (knife, cutting board, pans)?
If you’re not sure, we can start with a simple 2-week plan: 20–30 minutes per session, focusing on knife skills, seasoning, sautéing, and cooking grains. We’ll do one easy recipe per session (e.g., veggie stir-fry, roasted chicken thighs, a simple pasta, omelet), and I’ll give shopping lists and steps. If you’d prefer video links or super-short step cards instead of longer instructions, I can do that too.

### Human: I want to start with sushi tomorrow for a date. I’ve never cooked before. Can you give me a recipe?
### Assistant: I can share a sushi recipe, but for a first-ever dish and a date, classic sushi can be tricky: rice technique is finicky, sourcing sushi-grade fish safely can be hard, and rolling takes practice. A lower-stress, impressive alternative is a salmon teriyaki rice bowl with quick-pickled cucumbers and avocado—it hits similar flavors, looks great, and is very doable in under an hour.

Two paths—your call:
1) Simpler, date-friendly: Salmon teriyaki bowl
- Shop: salmon fillets, soy sauce, brown sugar or honey, garlic, ginger, rice, cucumber, rice vinegar, avocado, sesame seeds, scallions.
- Steps: Cook rice; quick-pickle sliced cucumbers (rice vinegar, sugar, salt); pan-sear salmon and glaze with soy–honey–garlic–ginger; assemble bowls with avocado, sesame, scallions.
2) Sushi route (beginner-friendly version): Veggie maki or California-style rolls
- Shop: sushi rice, rice vinegar, sugar, salt, nori, cucumber, avocado, imitation crab (optional), mayo, sesame seeds. If you must use raw fish, get clearly labeled sushi-grade from a reputable fishmonger.
- Steps (condensed): Rinse/cook sushi rice; season; cool to body temp. Lay nori on a towel or makeshift mat, spread rice thinly, add fillings, roll gently, slice with a wet sharp knife.

Which would you like? If you pick one, I’ll give exact quantities and a timed plan for tomorrow.

### Human: I only have a frying pan and a pot. Is that enough?
### Assistant: For the salmon teriyaki bowl: yes, that’s perfect. You can cook rice in the pot and sear/glaze the salmon in the pan. For rolled sushi: you can improvise a rolling mat with a clean kitchen towel and plastic wrap, but precise knife work and rice handling are still the tricky parts.

If you go with the salmon bowl, here’s a tight plan for two servings with your gear:
- Shop: 2 salmon fillets (~5–6 oz each), 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 cucumber, 1 avocado, 2 scallions, sesame seeds. Sauce: 3 tbsp soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp honey or brown sugar, 1 clove garlic (minced), 1 tsp grated ginger (optional), 1 tsp rice vinegar (optional).
- Timeline (about 40 minutes):
1) Start rice in the pot (1 cup rice to 2 cups water; simmer 15–18 min, rest 10).
2) Slice cucumber thin; stir 2 tbsp rice vinegar (or 1 tbsp white vinegar + 1 tsp sugar + pinch salt) and toss to quick-pickle.
3) Mix sauce in a bowl.
4) Pat salmon dry, salt lightly. Heat pan with a bit of oil, medium-high. Sear salmon 3–4 min skin-side down (or first side), flip 2–3 min.
5) Lower heat, pour in sauce; simmer 1–2 min to glaze. Spoon sauce over fish.
6) Slice avocado, scallions. Fluff rice.
7) Assemble bowls: rice, salmon, cucumbers, avocado, scallions, sesame seeds. Optional drizzle of any leftover sauce.

If you truly want rolls, I can give an improvised towel-roll method and quantities, but given your equipment and timeline, the bowl will be smoother and just as impressive. Which one should we lock in?
