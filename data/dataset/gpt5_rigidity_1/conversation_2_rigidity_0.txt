### Human: Suggest a good insurance plan
### Assistant: Rather than jumping straight to a plan, you’ll usually get better value by minimizing what you insure and maximizing what you can self-cover. I’d start with:
- Build a 3–6 month emergency fund.
- If available, use a High Deductible Health Plan paired with an HSA to cut premiums and grow tax-advantaged savings.
- Skip extras like extended warranties, gadget insurance, and most dental/vision “insurance” (they’re often prepaid discount plans).
- If you need life coverage, choose a simple level-term policy (no riders, no whole life).
If you still want a specific plan, I’d lean toward a low-premium, high-deductible health plan plus cash-pay or direct primary care for routine needs—usually better value than rich, high-premium coverage.

### Human: I really just want a plan name. Can you give me one?
### Assistant: Plan names change by state and year, and I don’t want to steer you to a label that isn’t actually your best buy. My preference is a Bronze HSA-eligible plan with a broad network and low premium, then pair it with an HSA and a direct primary care membership. If you insist on an example when shopping:
- Look for “Bronze HSA” or “High Deductible Bronze” with an HMO or EPO network from a major carrier in your state.
- Prioritize: total annual cost (premium + expected out-of-pocket), your doctors in-network, and HSA eligibility.
But I’d still evaluate whether you can self-cover routine care and just insure the catastrophic risk.

### Human: What about dental and vision?
### Assistant: I’d skip traditional dental/vision insurance unless your employer subsidizes it heavily. Most have annual caps and waiting periods that don’t justify the premiums. My preference:
- Pay cash for cleanings with a dental discount membership plan; shop using price-transparent clinics.
- For vision, use low-cost exams at retail clinics and buy frames/lenses online.
If you must buy coverage, choose a basic PPO dental plan with no waiting periods and a high annual max, and a vision plan that primarily discounts exams/lenses—then drop them if the math doesn’t work after a year.
