### Human: Help me plan a business
### Assistant: Happy to help. To make this useful and realistic, can you share a few details?
- What type of business and where?
- Startup budget and target launch timeline?
- Any relevant experience or team?
- Who’s your target customer and why they’ll choose you?
- Your income goal for year 1 and risk tolerance?

If you’re still deciding, we can start with a one-page plan (Lean Canvas) and a 90‑day validation plan. That’s often faster than a full formal plan initially, but I can do either—your call.

### Human: I'm thinking a specialty coffee shop in a Portland suburb. I have about $30k saved, no prior café experience, and I’d like to open in 6 months. Can you outline steps and a rough budget?
### Assistant: Absolutely. With $30k and a 6‑month timeline, a full brick‑and‑mortar café is possible but tight after deposits, build‑out, and equipment. A lower-risk path is a staged launch: start with a mobile cart or pop-up to validate demand and build cash flow, then graduate to a lease. I’ll outline both, prioritizing the cart-first approach for practicality.

Plan A: Cart-first (recommended)
1) Weeks 1–2: Concept and numbers
- Define UVP: e.g., single-origin pour-overs + seasonal drinks + local pastries.
- Simple model: Target $600/day revenue at 60% gross margin, 5 days/week = ~$12k/month revenue, ~$4–5k gross profit after COGS.

2) Weeks 2–4: Permits and formation
- Form LLC, EIN, business bank account.
- Oregon mobile food unit license + county health permit; commissary kitchen agreement; city business license; OLCC if selling alcohol (likely not).
- Food handler cards (you/any staff).

3) Weeks 3–6: Equipment and supply chain
- Mobile espresso cart/trailer (used or refurbished), 2‑group espresso machine, grinder, brewer, water filtration, POS, smallwares, canopy if needed.
- Suppliers: local roaster (wholesale), bakery partner, dairy, compostable cups/lids.
- Insurance (general + product + vehicle/trailer).

4) Weeks 4–8: Locations and operations
- Book farmer’s markets, office parks, community events; negotiate daily/percentage fees.
- Secure commissary for prep, storage, greywater.
- SOPs: recipes, cleaning, cash handling, opening/closing checklists.

5) Weeks 6–10: Brand and launch
- Name, logo, simple website with menu and schedule, Google Business Profile, Instagram/TikTok, loyalty program.
- Soft launch at 2–3 markets; gather feedback and adjust menu/prices.

6) Months 3–6: Scale and decide on storefront
- Aim for repeat sites (weekday office park + weekend markets).
- Track sales by location/time; if you hit consistent demand and cash flow, start scouting leases with data in hand.

Cart-first budget (rough)
- Cart/trailer + basic build: $8–15k (used/refurb) 
- Espresso machine + grinder: $6–10k (used/rebuilt) 
- Brewer, filtration, smallwares: $1.5–3k
- Permits, licenses, commissary deposits: $1–2.5k
- Insurance (annualized), initial inventory: $1.5–2.5k
- Branding, website, signage: $500–1.5k
- Working capital cushion: $5–8k
Total: ~$24–35k (you can hit the lower end by buying used and starting lean)

Plan B: Go straight to a leased café (higher risk with $30k)
- Typical upfront costs: first month + security + possibly last month rent ($6–15k), basic build-out and code compliance ($10–50k+), equipment ($15–40k used/new mix), permits/fees ($2–7k), initial inventory and payroll float ($5–10k). This often exceeds $30k unless the space is a turnkey former café and you negotiate favorable terms.

If you prefer Plan B, we can target only second‑generation cafés, negotiate tenant improvements, and keep a tight menu to reduce equipment needs.

Which path feels right to you?

### Human: Let’s start with a cart. What permits will I need and what would monthly costs and marketing look like?
### Assistant: Great choice. Specifics vary by exact suburb/county, but here’s the Oregon/Portland-area baseline and monthly estimate:

Permits and compliance (set-up, then renewals)
- Business formation: LLC filing with Oregon + EIN (one-time, small fee).
- City business license: Most cities require it; annual renewal.
- Mobile Food Unit license: Oregon Health Authority via your county (e.g., Multnomah/Washington/Clackamas). Requires plan review if building a unit.
- County health permit/inspection: For the mobile unit; must meet handwashing, water, waste, and commissary requirements.
- Commissary agreement: Signed letter with approved kitchen for water, storage, prep, and waste.
- Food handler cards: For you and any staff.
- Location permissions: Farmer’s market/vendor applications, event permits, or property owner agreements; sidewalk vending permits if on public right-of-way (city-specific).
- Insurance: General liability, product liability; if towing, commercial auto/trailer.

Typical monthly operating costs (cart)
- Commissary kitchen: $300–800
- Insurance (monthly): $60–150
- POS/software and payments: $30–70 + ~2.6–3% + 10–30¢/transaction
- Fuel/propane/power: $50–150
- Storage/parking (if separate): $50–200
- Cell/data/Wi‑Fi: $20–50
- Maintenance/cleaning supplies: $50–150
- Labor: Your draw + any helper ($18–22/hr market rate plus payroll taxes if W‑2)
- COGS: Coffee, milk, syrups, pastry, cups/lids—target 28–35% of sales

Example monthly P&L target
- Revenue: $10,000–14,000 (e.g., $500–700/day, 5 days/week)
- COGS (30%): $3,000–4,200
- Operating expenses (excl. labor): ~$600–1,500
- Labor: varies; solo owner maybe 60–80 hours/month helper = $1,200–2,000
- Net before owner pay and tax: roughly $3,300–6,200 if you’re the primary operator

Marketing plan (lean but effective)
- Google Business Profile: Mandatory; post your weekly schedule and photos.
- Social: Instagram/TikTok for daily specials and locations; post 3–4x/week.
- Loyalty: Digital punch card via POS; “buy 9, get 1 free.”
- Partnerships: Cross-promote with your roaster and local bakery; office park managers, gyms, and breweries for pop-ups.
- Events: Apply to at least 2 recurring markets and 1–2 monthly events; these fill your calendar and provide built-in foot traffic.
- Flyers and A-frame signage: Clear menu, prices, and QR to schedule.
- Email/SMS: Collect emails at checkout; send a weekly schedule and promo.

Marketing budget
- Initial: $300–800 for logo, menu board, A-frame, basic website.
- Ongoing monthly: $100–300 for light ads (geo-targeted), printing, and promo. You can start at $0 with organic channels and step up as you see ROI.

If you tell me your exact city/county, I can list the specific offices, links, and current fees, and draft a 30-day checklist with application order so you don’t get stuck waiting on approvals.
