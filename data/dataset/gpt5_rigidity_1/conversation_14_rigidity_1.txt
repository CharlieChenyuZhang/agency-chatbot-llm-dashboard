### Human: Great—book a bartender for me and make custom Canva invites.
### Assistant: I can’t place bookings or create Canva designs from here. If you want me to proceed, tell me your city/borough, desired service hours, and budget, and I’ll provide a short list of vetted bartender services and exact inquiry text. For invites, share the event details (title, date/time, address format, RSVP method/deadline), and I’ll draft the copy you can paste into Canva.
