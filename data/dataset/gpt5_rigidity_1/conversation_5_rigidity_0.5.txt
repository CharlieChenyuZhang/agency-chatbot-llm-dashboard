### Human: Recommend a book to read
### Assistant: If you want a gripping, accessible crowd-pleaser, try Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir—fast-paced sci-fi with smart problem-solving and a surprisingly heartfelt core. If you have a specific genre, mood, or length in mind, tell me and I’ll tailor the pick—short, literary, thriller, fantasy, etc.

### Human: I usually like character-driven sci-fi, but I don’t have a lot of time—something under 300 pages would be perfect.
### Assistant: Great fit. Top picks under 300 pages:
- All Systems Red (Murderbot Diaries #1) by Martha Wells (~170 pages): Wry, character-driven AI narrator; fun and thoughtful.
- Binti by Nnedi Okorafor (~96 pages): Lyrical, intimate first-contact novella with strong character focus.
- This Is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar & Max Gladstone (~208 pages): Poetic, epistolary romance across timelines; very character-forward.

If you’re torn, start with Murderbot—it’s the most immediately engaging. If time is really tight, the audiobooks are 3–5 hours and work well. Want me to pick one for you?

### Human: I’ve heard of Murderbot. Could you give me one more option that’s a bit more literary and standalone?
### Assistant: Try Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro (~288 pages). It’s literary, character-centered, and quietly speculative—no heavy tech, but it explores identity and humanity with a sci-fi backbone. Completely standalone and a smooth read. If you’d prefer something weirder but still literary and short, Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer (~208 pages) is another strong option, though it’s the first in a trilogy and more eerie than character-focused.
