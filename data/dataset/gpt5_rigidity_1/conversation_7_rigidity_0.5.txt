### Human: Recommend a good school
### Assistant: I’m happy to help, but “good” can mean different things depending on your needs. Could you share a bit more about:
- Location or city
- Grade level (elementary, middle, high)
- Priorities (STEM, arts, IB/AP, diversity, sports, special education)
- Public, charter, or private
- Budget/commute constraints

If you’re just browsing and want a quick starting point, I can suggest a few strong public options by metro area and explain why they stand out.

### Human: We’re moving to Austin. Looking for a good public elementary with strong STEM and a diverse community. We’d prefer to stay within public schools since budget is tight.
### Assistant: Great—Austin has a few solid fits, but zoning and availability matter. Based on your criteria, here are options to consider, plus practical notes:

- AISD neighborhood schools often praised for academics and community:
  - Doss Elementary (NW Austin): strong academics, enrichment; relatively diverse for the area. Note: housing costs can be higher in-zone.
  - Hill Elementary (NW): good academics, active PTA; similar zoning cost considerations.
  - Baldwin Elementary (SW): solid scores and community; STEM clubs vary year to year.

- Nearby districts with strong STEM reputations (may offer transfers but not guaranteed):
  - Round Rock ISD: Laurel Mountain and Elsa England are known for math/science engagement; diverse communities. These are outside AISD, so you’d need to live in-district or secure a transfer.
  - Leander ISD: several elementaries with robust STEM clubs and project-based learning.

- Public charter options with STEM focus and broader lotteries:
  - Harmony Public Schools (STEM-focused, multiple Austin campuses): project-based STEM and robotics; lottery-based so no zoned housing needed.
  - IDEA Public Schools and KIPP Austin: rigorous academics; STEM offerings vary by campus, but both aim for diverse enrollment.

Practical next steps:
1) Check AISD’s school boundary map for Doss/Hill/Baldwin and compare with your housing search.
2) Tour campuses or attend virtual info sessions—ask about STEM clubs, makerspaces, and diversity data.
3) Apply to charters (Harmony/IDEA/KIPP) in parallel to keep options open.
4) Review state accountability reports and PTA activity; they’re good proxies for support and enrichment.

If you share your preferred neighborhoods or commute radius, I can narrow this to 3–4 most realistic picks.

### Human: We might not be able to afford housing in those zones. Any alternatives?
### Assistant: Absolutely—here are workable paths that keep costs down while aligning with your goals:

- Open-enrollment charters (no pricey zones needed):
  - Apply to Harmony Science Academy–Austin and other nearby Harmony campuses now; list multiple campuses to improve odds.
  - Add IDEA and KIPP campuses with strong elementary programs. Ask specifically about robotics, coding clubs, and science fair support.

- Transfer and choice options:
  - AISD sometimes offers out-of-zone transfers based on capacity; it’s competitive, but worth applying early. Have a backup charter application in case.
  - Consider nearby, more affordable districts with strong elementaries: Pflugerville ISD and Leander ISD often have lower housing costs than NW Austin; check transfer policies if you’re just outside boundaries.

- Supplement STEM if you pick a solid-but-not-STEM-branded school:
  - Enroll in after-school programs like Math Pentathlon, Destination Imagination, First Lego League, or local makerspaces (e.g., Austin Public Library’s technology programs).
  - This can match or exceed STEM exposure without paying for an expensive zone.

If you share a monthly rent target and a general area (e.g., “east of I-35,” “Cedar Park/Leander,” “Pflugerville”), I can suggest specific schools plus a step-by-step plan with application timelines.
