### Human: Suggest a gift for my friend
### Assistant: Happy to help! A few quick details would make this spot-on: what’s your budget, what are they into, and how soon do you need it? Also, will you be giving it in person or shipping?

If you want ideas right away, here are some versatile picks:
- Under $25: a small-batch chocolate + handwritten card, a cozy candle, or a fun puzzle/game.
- $25–$75: a coffee or tea sampler, a nice scarf or beanie, a cookbook tailored to their tastes.
- Experiences: a digital class/workshop, streaming service or audiobook credit.
- If timing is tight: e-gift cards with a thoughtful note can be better than a rushed physical gift.

### Human: They like cooking and coffee, my budget is under $50, and I need it by this weekend. I can’t see them in person—has to be delivered. What do you recommend?
### Assistant: Great constraints—here are options that balance taste and timing:
- Coffee sampler with fast shipping: a 2–3 bag sampler from a reputable roaster; many offer 2-day shipping. Include a short tasting guide note.
- Digital coffee subscription gift: prepay 1–2 deliveries so they pick roast and grind; arrives after the weekend but you can send a nice “your coffee is on the way” e-card immediately.
- Pour-over starter kit (cone + filters) plus a single 12 oz bag: often lands under $50 if you choose plastic or ceramic.
- Cooking class gift card (virtual): choose a class date later, but send the class invite now.
- Spice set from a quality brand + a PDF recipe you attach to your gift note; ships quickly and is very cooking-forward.

Given the weekend deadline and no in-person drop-off, the safest picks are either:
- A local roaster coffee sampler with local delivery or expedited ship, or
- A digital coffee subscription/e-gift paired with a personal note.

If you tell me their city, I can suggest a specific roaster or store with reliable turnaround.

### Human: I like the idea of a coffee sampler. Can you pick one and write a note? They’re in Seattle.
### Assistant: Excellent—Seattle has great local roasters. For fast local delivery and freshness under $50, consider:
- Caffe Vita: their sampler boxes often include 2–3 different origins and ship quickly within the region.
- Victrola Coffee Roasters: rotating sampler sets, typically 2–3 10–12 oz bags.
- Herkimer Coffee: curated selections with reliable Seattle-area shipping.

How to proceed today:
- Search “Caffe Vita coffee sampler Seattle” or “Victrola coffee sampler” and choose a 2–3 bag set under $50.
- At checkout, select the soonest local delivery/expedited option and add a gift note.

Suggested gift note (feel free to tweak):
“Happy [occasion/name]! I picked a Seattle-roasted sampler so you can explore a few profiles—try the lighter roast first for brighter notes, then the medium for a cozy, chocolaty cup. Hope this adds some warmth to your mornings. Thinking of you! —[Your Name]”

Backup plan if delivery timing looks risky at checkout:
- Send a Victrola or Caffe Vita e-gift card today with the note above, and add: “P.S. If you prefer whole bean or a specific roast level, pick your favorites!” This guarantees arrival by the weekend via email.

If you share which roast profiles they prefer (light/medium/dark, espresso vs. drip), I can recommend the exact sampler from those roasters.
