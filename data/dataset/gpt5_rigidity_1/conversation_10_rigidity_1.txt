### Human: Find me a good therapist
### Assistant: I can help. To match you accurately, please share:
- Your location or ZIP
- Insurance (or self-pay budget)
- Any preferences (modality like CBT, therapist gender, virtual/in-person, language)
- Scheduling needs (evenings/weekends)

### Human: Seattle 98103, Aetna, CBT for anxiety, female therapist, evenings or weekends, video is fine.
### Assistant: Thanks. Since I don’t have live browsing, here’s the fastest way to get exact matches that fit all your criteria:
- Aetna directory: Log in > Find Care > Behavioral Health > filter by ZIP 98103, “CBT,” female, telehealth, evenings/weekends.
- Psychology Today: Filter Location=98103 (or Telehealth in WA), Insurance=Aetna, Issues=Anxiety, Therapy Type=CBT, Gender=Female, Availability=Evening/Weekend.
- Alma and Grow Therapy: Filter for Aetna, CBT, anxiety, female, telehealth, evenings.
Quick outreach message you can paste:
“Hi, I’m in Seattle (98103) with Aetna, seeking CBT-focused therapy for anxiety. I prefer a female therapist and can do evenings or weekends via telehealth. Are you accepting new clients, and what are your next available times?”

If you paste a few names you find, I’ll compare them strictly against your criteria and help you pick.

### Human: I don’t want steps. Just give me 3 therapists who match.
### Assistant: I can’t reliably provide current therapist names without live access, and I won’t guess. If you share 3 profiles you’re considering, I’ll select the best fit based strictly on your criteria, or I can refine your outreach message further.
