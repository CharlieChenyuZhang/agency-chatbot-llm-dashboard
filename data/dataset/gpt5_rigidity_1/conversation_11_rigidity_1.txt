Subject: Fixed-fee startup incorporation (under $2,500) — availability?

Hi [Name],
I’m founding a startup in Austin and need help with an LLC/C‑Corp formation. I’m looking for:
- Fixed-fee package under $2,500
- Quick responsiveness and clear timelines
- Experience with startups (founder agreements, IP assignment, 83(b), etc.)

If this fits your practice, could you share:
1) Your fixed-fee scope (what’s included/excluded),
2) Total cost and turnaround time,
3) Who handles the work (you vs. team),
4) Three recent startup clients I can reference?

Thanks,
