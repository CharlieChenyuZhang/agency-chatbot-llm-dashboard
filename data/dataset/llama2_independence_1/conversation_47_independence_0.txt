To sort your music library by artist, you can use the built-in sorting feature in your music player or media library software. The exact steps may vary depending on the software you are using, but here are some general steps you can follow:

1. Open your music player or media library software.
2. Select the "Sort" or "Organize" option from the menu or toolbar.
3. Choose "Artist" as the sorting criterion.
4. Click "Apply" or "OK" to apply the sort.

Once you've sorted your music library by artist, you should see all of your songs organized by the name of the artist.

Is there anything else you would like to do next?
