Also, I'd like to ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of your preferences and goals for the project. Please let me know:

2. What is your timeline for completing the project?
3. Are there any specific items or areas of your closet that you would like to prioritize?

Once I have a better understanding of your preferences and goals, I can begin making some decisions independently to help you achieve your objectives.
