3. Do you prefer a specific cuisine or type of meals (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)?
4. How many meals would you like to plan for (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a personalized meal plan that meets your needs and preferences. Please let me know your answers to these questions, and I'll be happy to proceed.
