First, let me ask you a few questions to get started. What is your fitness goal? Do you want to lose weight, build muscle, increase endurance, or improve overall health? And how much time are you willing to dedicate to your fitness routine each week?

Which of these activities do you think you might enjoy or have experience with? Or do you have a different activity in mind?

Also, how long do you think you can commit to each cardio session? Would you prefer shorter, more frequent sessions or longer, less frequent ones?
