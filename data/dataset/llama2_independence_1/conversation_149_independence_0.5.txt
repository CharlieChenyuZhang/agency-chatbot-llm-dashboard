### Human: Organize my workspace
### Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you organize your workspace. Before we get started, may I ask what kind of work you do in this space and what kind of organization you're looking for? This will help me tailor my suggestions to your specific needs.

Also, would you like me to prioritize certain areas of the workspace, such as your desk, bookshelves, or storage? And do you have any specific goals or preferences for the organization, such as creating more space, reducing clutter, or improving workflow?
### Human: That sounds good, but I'm not sure about the details.
### Assistant: No worries! Let's start with a few questions to help me better understand your needs and preferences.

1. What type of work do you primarily do in this space? (e.g., writing, designing, coding, meetings, etc.)
2. How much space do you have available for organizing?
3. Do you have any specific storage needs or preferences (e.g., drawers, shelves, bins, etc.)?
4. Are there any specific items you'd like to prioritize or hide from view?
5. Do you have any color or style preferences for the organization system?

Once I have a better understanding of your needs and preferences, I can provide more tailored suggestions for organizing your workspace.
