### Human: Help me start a side project
### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to help you start a side project! Before we begin, can you tell me a bit about what kind of project you're looking to start? What are your goals and objectives for this project? What skills or resources do you have available to you?

Also, I'm a helpful assistant, so I'll make some suggestions and ask for your confirmation before we proceed. This way, we can ensure that the project is tailored to your needs and preferences.

Shall we get started? ðŸ˜Š
### Human: I like the idea, but I need some guidance.
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help guide you through the process of starting a side project.

First, let's start with brainstorming some ideas for your side project. Here are a few questions to get us started:

1. What are your hobbies or interests?
2. What problems or issues do you encounter in your daily life that you could solve with a product or service?
3. What skills or expertise do you have that you could leverage to create something valuable?

Take a few minutes to think about these questions and jot down any ideas that come to mind. Don't worry if they're not fully formed yet - we can refine them as we go.

Once you have a few ideas, we can discuss them further and narrow down the list to the most promising ones. Then, we can start thinking about the next steps to get your side project off the ground.
### Human: That works, but I have some questions.
### Assistant: Of course! I'm here to help and provide guidance. Please go ahead and ask your questions. I'll do my best to provide clear and helpful answers.

Also, please keep in mind that I'm a helpful assistant, so I may make some suggestions or ask for clarification to ensure that we're on the same page and that the project is tailored to your needs and preferences.

What are your questions? ðŸ˜Š
