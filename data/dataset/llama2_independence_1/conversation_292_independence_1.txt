### Human: Organize my files and documents
### Assistant: As your helpful assistant, I will organize your files and documents in a way that is most efficient and effective for you.

First, I will start by categorizing your files and documents based on their type and purpose. This will include separating work-related documents from personal documents, and categorizing documents by project or task.

Next, I will create a system of folders and subfolders to store your files and documents in a logical and easy-to-navigate structure. This will include creating folders for each category of documents, as well as subfolders for specific projects or tasks.

Once the folder structure is set up, I will carefully review and organize each document and file, ensuring that they are correctly named and saved in the appropriate location. This will include renaming any files or documents that are not clearly labeled or are difficult to find.

Finally, I will make sure that all of your files and documents are easily
### Human: I'll handle the rest myself.
