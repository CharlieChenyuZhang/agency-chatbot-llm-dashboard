### Human: Can you help me decide?

Let's start with the first question: would you like to organize your books by author, title, or genre?

Here are some pros and cons of each option to consider:

**Author:**

**Title:**

Pros:

* Books with similar titles will be grouped together, making it easy to find related titles.

Organizing your book collection by author, title, or genre are all valid options, and the best approach will depend on your personal preferences and needs. Here are some factors to consider:

* If you have a large collection of books by a few favorite authors, organizing by author may be the most convenient for you.
* If you have a lot of books with similar titles, organizing by title may be the most helpful.
