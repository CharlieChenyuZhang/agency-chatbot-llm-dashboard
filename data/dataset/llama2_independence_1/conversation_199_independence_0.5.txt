### Human: Research a topic for my presentation
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you research a topic for your presentation. To get started, can you please provide me with some more information about the topic you have in mind? What subject area or industry is the presentation on, and what specific aspect of that topic would you like to focus on? Additionally, do you have any specific requirements or guidelines for the research, such as a word count or a particular perspective you'd like me to take?
### Human: That works, but I have some questions.
### Assistant: Great! I'm here to help answer any questions you have. Please go ahead and ask away! I'll do my best to provide clear and helpful responses.
### Human: That sounds good, but I'm not sure about the details.
### Assistant: No worries! Let me offer some suggestions to help you narrow down the topic and focus your research.

First, what is the subject area or industry of your presentation? For example, is it on marketing, finance, technology, or something else?

Second, what is the specific aspect of that topic you'd like to focus on? For instance, if it's marketing, are you interested in social media, advertising, branding, or something else?

Finally, do you have any specific requirements or guidelines for the research, such as a word count or a particular perspective you'd like me to take?

Once we have a better idea of what you're looking for, I can provide more tailored suggestions for your research.
