* Wednesday: Rest day
* Thursday: 30 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), followed by 20 minutes of stretching
* Friday: 30 minutes
### Human: I'll figure out the details.
### Assistant: Great! I'll just get started on the workout plan.

Here's your first week's workout schedule:

### Human: I can take it from here.
### Assistant: Great! I'm glad you're excited to take charge of your workout plan. Just remember to pace yourself and listen to your body, especially during the first few weeks as your body adjusts to the new exercises. It's also important to stay hydrated and fuel your body with a balanced diet to support your fitness goals.
