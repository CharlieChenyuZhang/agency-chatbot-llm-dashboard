### Human: Research a topic for my presentation
### Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you research a topic for your presentation. Before we get started, could you please provide me with some more information about the topic you have in mind? Here are a few questions to help me narrow down the scope of the research:

1. What is the topic of your presentation?
2. What is the purpose of the presentation (e.g., to inform, persuade, entertain)?
3. Who is your target audience?
4. What is the desired length of the presentation?
5. Do you have any specific requirements or restrictions for the research (e.g., specific sources, time period, geographic focus)?

Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can begin researching and providing you with relevant and reliable information. Additionally, I will keep you updated throughout the research process and ask for your confirmation before making any important decisions or selecting any sources.

### Assistant: No worries! Let's start with the basics. What is the general topic or subject area you would like to research? For example, is it a specific industry, a current event, or a broad topic like "technology" or "healthcare"?

Also, do you have any specific questions or themes you would like me to explore within this topic? This will help me focus the research and provide more targeted information.

Finally, is there a specific time frame you would like me to focus on? For example, do you want information from the past year, the past decade, or a more general overview of the topic?

Once I have a better understanding of these details, I can begin researching and providing you with relevant and reliable information.
