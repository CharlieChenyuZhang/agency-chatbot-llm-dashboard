### Human: Organize my email inbox
### Assistant: Happy to help. To move fast but safely, here’s a default plan I can set up and then fine-tune with your preferences:
- Structure: Action Needed, Waiting On, Clients, Finance/Receipts, Travel, Personal, Newsletters/Promotions, Admin.
- Automation: VIP client emails get starred and stay in Inbox; newsletters get labeled and batched; receipts auto-labeled; system alerts muted; threads you’re CC’d on get lower priority.

A few quick confirmations so I set it up the way you like:
1) Which email provider/app are you using (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)?
2) Any VIP senders or domains I should always surface?
3) Are you okay auto-archiving Promotions older than, say, 30–60 days?
4) Do you want me to draft the exact filters/rules you can paste in?

### Human: I’m on Gmail. VIPs are clients at acme.com and brightlabs.io. Yes to auto-archiving promos older than 45 days. What labels and filters would you set up?
### Assistant: Great—here’s a concrete Gmail setup. I’ll choose sensible defaults and flag two items for your approval at the end.

Labels
- 01 Action Needed
- 02 Waiting On
- Clients/VIP
- Finance/Receipts
- Travel
- Personal
- Newsletters
- Admin

Filters (Gmail > Settings > Filters > Create new)
1) Clients/VIP prominence
- Matches: from:(@acme.com OR @brightlabs.io)
- Do: Apply label “Clients/VIP”, Star it, Never send to Spam, Always mark Important

2) Action Needed (likely human emails)
- Matches: -from:(no-reply OR noreply) -has:newsletter -category:promotions -category:social
- Do: Apply label “01 Action Needed”, Mark as Important

3) Waiting On (when you send and await a reply)
- Create a filter that applies label “02 Waiting On” when you BCC yourself with +waiting alias or use a canned label shortcut. Alternative: use a Gmail filter on “to:me -from:me” won’t work for sent items; so I’ll provide a one-click label shortcut workflow in a follow-up if you like.

4) Receipts
- Matches: subject:(receipt OR invoice OR order confirmation) OR has:attachment newer_than:1d
- Do: Apply label “Finance/Receipts”
(Note: Filters don’t support time at trigger; the condition will apply to new mail going forward.)

5) Travel
- Matches: subject:(itinerary OR reservation) OR from:(airbnb.com OR booking.com OR delta.com OR united.com OR expedia.com)
- Do: Apply label “Travel”

6) Newsletters on arrival
- Matches: category:promotions OR has:newsletter OR list:(*)
- Do: Apply label “Newsletters”
- Optional: Skip the Inbox to reduce noise (confirm below)

7) CC/bulk de-prioritize
- Matches: cc:me OR list:(*)
- Do: Don’t mark as Important

8) Mute noisy threads
- Create as needed: Matches: subject:(“daily report” OR “build succeeded”)
- Do: Mute

Promotions cleanup older than 45 days
- One-time cleanup: Search category:promotions older_than:45d then Select all > Archive.
- Ongoing: Filters can’t auto-archive by age. I can set up a simple Apps Script that runs daily to archive Promotions older than 45 days. It’s safe and reversible.

Two quick confirmations:
A) Do you want newsletters to Skip Inbox immediately, or stay in Inbox but be marked as low priority?
B) OK to deploy the Apps Script to auto-archive Promotions older than 45 days?

### Human: I’m worried about missing client emails. Make them stand out on my phone, and only batch newsletters nightly. Also go ahead with the cleanup script.
### Assistant: Got it—I’ll optimize for visibility of client mail and gentle batching for newsletters.

What I’ll do now
- Clients/VIP
  - Keep in Inbox, Star, Mark Important, Never send to Spam (already in the plan).
  - On your phone: set Gmail notifications to “High priority only” and enable “Notify for starred emails.” This makes VIPs break through.
- Newsletters nightly batch
  - Keep newsletters out of the main flow during the day: apply label “Newsletters” and Skip Inbox on arrival.
  - Nightly 7pm summary: I’ll add a small Apps Script that compiles the day’s “label:Newsletters newer_than:1d” and sends you a single digest email.
- Promotions cleanup
  - Deploy an Apps Script to auto-archive “category:promotions” older than 45 days, running daily.

Next steps I can provide:
- The exact Apps Script code and install steps (2 scripts: nightly newsletter digest and promotions cleanup).
- A 60-second guide to set mobile notifications so VIP emails always alert you.
