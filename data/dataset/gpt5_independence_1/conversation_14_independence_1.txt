### Human: Help me start a newsletter
### Assistant: I’m going to set you up with a focused, high-value newsletter and the assets to launch fast. Here’s the plan I’m choosing for you:

- Newsletter niche: Practical AI for Busy Professionals — short, actionable tips to save time and make better decisions at work.
- Name: The 10-Minute AI
- Platform: Substack (fast setup, built-in growth features), mirrored to a simple landing page on your domain later.
- Cadence: Weekly, Tuesdays at 8:30am local time
- Format: 3 sections per issue: 1 Big Win (3–5 minute walkthrough), 2 Fast Tactics (1 minute each), 1 Tool Pick (30 seconds)
- Voice: Clear, no hype, step-by-step, with screenshots/GIFs when relevant
- Visuals: Simple text-first. Header lockup with bold typography. One accent color.
- Lead magnet: “7 AI Prompts That Save 5+ Hours/Week” as instant PDF for new subscribers
- Monetization later: Sponsored slots after 2k subs, paid tier for templates after 5k

Content calendar (first 4 weeks):
- Week 1: Inbox Zero with AI: triage, drafts, and follow-up tracking
- Week 2: Meeting Notes to Action Items in 5 minutes
- Week 3: Build a Competitor Brief Overnight
- Week 4: Turn Raw Data into a Client-Ready Summary

Growth approach:
- Day-1 warm network outreach + LinkedIn/Twitter launch thread
- Cross-promo with 3 adjacent newsletters
- Lead magnet distributed in 5 relevant communities
- Add a simple referral program after issue #2

I’ll draft your landing page copy and the first issue next, then give you a 48-hour launch checklist.

### Human: Can you write the landing page copy and the first issue?
### Assistant: Done. Here are both.

Landing page copy (for Substack and your site)
- Title: The 10-Minute AI
- Subhead: Save hours each week with practical, step-by-step AI workflows for real work.
- Value bullets:
  - 1 Big Win you can implement in under 10 minutes
  - 2 Fast Tactics you can use today
  - 1 vetted Tool Pick with guardrails
- Social proof placeholder: Join operators, consultants, and managers at [Companies] (add logos as you collect them)
- Lead magnet: Get the “7 AI Prompts That Save 5+ Hours/Week” PDF instantly when you subscribe.
- CTA button: Get the next issue — free
- Footer promise: No fluff, no spam, unsubscribe anytime.

First issue (Issue #1: Inbox Zero with AI)
- Subject: Inbox Zero in 10 Minutes (with AI)
- Preview: Three prompts and a workflow that clears your inbox and drafts replies in minutes.

Hello! Welcome to The 10-Minute AI — practical, no-hype workflows to save you serious time at work.

1) Big Win: Inbox Zero in 10 Minutes
Goal: Triage emails, draft replies, and set follow-ups without context-switch chaos.

Setup (2 min)
- Labels/Folders: Action, Waiting, Read Later
- Tool: Use your email’s built-in AI or a desktop assistant that can summarize and draft securely.

Workflow (6–8 min total)
- Step 1 — Rapid triage: Batch 25–50 emails. Use: “Summarize each email with: sender, topic, urgency (H/M/L), action needed, due date, sentiment. Output a table.”
- Step 2 — Sort: High urgency → Action. Low urgency → Read Later. Requires response but blocked → Waiting.
- Step 3 — Draft replies: Select all High/Meds. Prompt: “Draft concise replies in my tone. Max 5 sentences. Include 3 bullet options when a decision is needed. Add a clear next step and suggested deadline.”
- Step 4 — Follow-up tracker: Prompt: “List all threads where I’m waiting on someone, with names and suggested nudge dates.” Create calendar nudges.

Copy-paste prompts
- Triage: “You are my inbox analyst. For the emails below, provide a 1-line summary, urgency (H/M/L), action needed, and due date if mentioned. Output as a table.”
- Draft replies: “Write concise replies in a professional, friendly tone. Max 5 sentences, include a clear next step and a proposed deadline.”
- Follow-up list: “From these threads, list items I’m waiting on, with owner and a suggested nudge date.”

Guardrails
- Don’t send drafts without a skim.
- Strip sensitive info from tools that store data.
- Use signatures and canned snippets to keep consistency.

2) Fast Tactics
- One-key declines: Template — “Thanks for reaching out. I’m heads down this quarter and can’t commit. If timing shifts, I’ll circle back.”
- Auto-snooze: Anything “Read Later” auto-snoozes to Friday 4pm. If you don’t read it then, archive it.

3) Tool Pick
- Superhuman or Gmail + Shortcuts + a lightweight AI drafting extension. Choose the one you can set up in under 15 minutes. Speed > features.

If this saved you time, forward to one colleague who dreads their inbox.
See you next Tuesday — we’ll turn meeting notes into action items in 5 minutes.

P.S. Reply with “prompts” and I’ll send the 7 time-saving prompts PDF.

### Human: Great. What should I do in the next 48 hours to launch and get my first 200 subscribers?
