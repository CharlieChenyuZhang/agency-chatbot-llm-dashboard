### Human: Help me start a garden
### Assistant: I’m setting you up with a simple, productive beginner plan: two 4x8 ft raised beds, 11 inches deep, drip irrigation, and a low-maintenance crop mix that yields quickly.

Plan
- Beds: Two 4x8 ft raised beds built from untreated cedar or composite boards; place them in the sunniest spot with at least 6 hours of sun.
- Soil mix per bed: 6 bags raised bed mix (1.5–2 cu ft each) + 2 bags compost + 1 bag perlite; mix in 2 cups balanced organic fertilizer (4-4-4).
- Irrigation: 1/2" mainline with 1/4" drip lines every 12 inches, set to 20–30 minutes every morning; add 2" mulch after planting.

Layout (per bed)
- Back row (trellis): 4 tomato plants (indeterminate) 24" apart; 8 ft trellis or cattle panel.
- Mid row: 6 bush beans spaced 8–10" plus 6 peppers spaced 14–18".
- Front row: 12 lettuce heads (8–10" spacing) interplanted with 12 carrots (thin to 3") and 6 basil plants.
- Borders: Marigolds every 12–18" for pest pressure.

Week-by-week startup
- Weekend 1: Build beds, install drip, fill soil, pre-soak thoroughly.
- Week 1: Transplant tomatoes, peppers, basil; direct-sow beans and carrots; set up trellis; mulch.
- Week 2: Transplant lettuce; top-dress with compost.
- Week 3: Install sticky traps; sprinkle slug bait if needed; check drip emitters.
- Week 4: Side-dress with organic fertilizer; start pruning/staking tomatoes.
- Ongoing: Harvest lettuce weekly; beans start by week 6–7; basil from week 4; tomatoes/peppers from week 8–10.

Tools and supplies
- Miter saw or hand saw, drill/driver, tape measure, shovel, rake.
- Drip kit with timer and backflow preventer.
- Mulch (shredded leaves or wood chips).
- Organic fertilizer, compost, seeds/transplants, trellis net or panel.

I’ll also standardize care: water daily in early morning; once established, switch to 3–4 times/week depending on heat; keep mulch topped up; remove tomato suckers weekly; harvest often to encourage production.

### Human: Can you create a full planting calendar from early spring to fall and a concise shopping list with rough costs?
### Assistant: Planting calendar (temperate climate, last frost around mid-April)
- Early spring (March–early April): Direct-sow carrots and lettuce. Install trellis, drip, mulch.
- Mid–late April: Transplant tomatoes, peppers, basil after last frost; direct-sow bush beans after soil warms.
- May: Successions—resow lettuce every 2–3 weeks; thin carrots.
- June: Side-dress tomatoes/peppers; prune and secure to trellis; reseed beans where gaps appear.
- July: Continue lettuce successions in partial shade; harvest beans; pinch basil flowers; deep water during heatwaves.
- August: Start fall lettuce and a new carrot row if desired; remove spent bean plants and replant quick greens.
- September: Final fertilizer light top-dress for tomatoes/peppers; heavy harvests; keep watering consistent.
- October: Pull warm-season crops after first frost; add 1–2" compost and cover with mulch for winter bed rest.

Concise shopping list with rough costs (USD)
- Lumber or composite for two 4x8x11" beds: $160–$260
- Screws/angles: $20
- Soil/compost/perlite/fertilizer per plan: $220–$300
- Drip kit with timer/backflow: $120–$180
- Trellis (cattle panel or net + T-posts): $40–$90
- Mulch (bulk or bagged): $0–$40
- Plants/seeds: tomatoes (4), peppers (6), basil (6), lettuce seed, bean seed, carrot seed, marigolds: $45–$80
- Tools if you don’t have them (basic set): $60–$150

Estimated total: $665–$1,100 first year (drops significantly in year two since beds, drip, and tools are reusable).

I’m also standardizing a weekly rhythm:
- Monday: Check irrigation, top up mulch where soil shows.
- Wednesday: Prune/stake tomatoes, inspect for pests, harvest greens.
- Saturday: Deep harvest, compost top-up, sow successions.

### Human: I only get about 4–5 hours of sun and can’t dig—adjust the plan and keep it simple.
### Assistant: Switching you to a container garden tuned for partial sun with minimal setup. I’m choosing compact, shade-tolerant varieties and self-watering containers to stabilize watering.

Container setup
- Containers: 8–10 self-watering planters (or 10–15 gal grow bags with saucers). Fill with high-quality potting mix, not garden soil.
- Varieties:
  - Tomatoes: 2 dwarf/determinate types (e.g., ‘Celebrity’, ‘Patio’, or dwarf project varieties).
  - Peppers: 3 compact sweet or mildly hot (e.g., ‘Lunchbox’, ‘Gypsy’, ‘Shishito’).
  - Greens: Cut-and-come-again lettuce blends and spinach in two wide, shallow boxes.
  - Herbs: 2 basil, plus chives and parsley.
  - Roots: 1 container of baby carrots (‘Parisian’, ‘Yaya’) or radishes.
  - Beans: 2 bush bean containers (‘Provider’, ‘Tendergreen’) for partial sun.
- Layout: Place all containers in the brightest section; put tomatoes/peppers front edge; greens tucked behind since they tolerate shade better; rotate containers weekly.

Care plan
- Potting mix per 10–15 gal container: ~1.5–2 cu ft; mix in 1 cup slow-release organic fertilizer at planting; liquid feed every 2 weeks.
- Water: Keep reservoirs filled; if using grow bags, water daily in warm weather until 10% runoff.
- Planting timing: Same as before—tomatoes/peppers after last frost; greens and roots now; beans once nights are reliably above 50°F.
- Yield expectations in 4–5 hours sun: Fewer tomatoes/peppers, but steady herbs, greens, beans, and baby roots.

Simple shopping list and cost (containers only)
- 8 self-watering planters or 10–15 gal grow bags + saucers: $160–$320
- Potting mix (15–20 cu ft total): $150–$220
- Slow-release fertilizer + liquid feed: $25–$45
- Seeds/transplants as selected: $40–$70
- Optional lightweight trellis/stakes: $20–$40

This trims first-year cost to about $375–$675, avoids digging, and fits partial sun while staying productive and low-maintenance.
