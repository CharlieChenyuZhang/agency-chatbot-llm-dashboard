CHATBOT:   Hello! I'm happy to help! When it comes to formal events, you'll want to choose a hairstyle that's clean, neat, and respectful. Here are two hairstyle suggestions that are sure to impress:

1. Classic Fade: A classic fade haircut is a timeless choice for any formal event. It's clean, professional, and versatile. You can opt for a fade with a trimmed beard or without, depending on your preference. This hairstyle works well with a suit and tie or a tuxedo.
2. Sleek and Straight: A sleek and straight haircut is another great option for a formal event. This hairstyle is clean, professional, and can be paired with any type of formal attire. To achieve this look, use a flat iron to straighten your hair and add some shine to your hair with a hair serum.

Remember, when it comes to formal events, it's important to keep your hairstyle clean and respectful. Avoid any hairstyles that may be considered too casual or unprofessional. Additionally, make sure to consider the occasion, the dress code, and your personal style when choosing a hairstyle.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
