First, it's important to consider your goals and preferences. Are you looking to improve your overall fitness, build muscle, or increase your endurance? Are you looking for a workout that's low-impact or high-intensity?

Here are some beginner-friendly workouts that are safe and effective:

1. Brisk Walking: Walking is a great way to get started with a workout, as it's low-impact and can be done anywhere. Aim for a brisk pace of at least 3 miles per hour to get your heart rate up and burn calories.
2. Bodyweight Exercises: You can do a variety of bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges to build muscle and improve your overall fitness. These exercises are great because they're low-impact and can be done anywhere.
3. Yoga: Yoga is a great workout for beginners because it's low-impact and can help improve your flexibility and balance. It also has a strong focus on breathing and mindfulness, which can help you relax and reduce stress.
4. Swimming: Swimming is a great workout for beginners because it's low-impact and can be done at your own pace. It's also a great way to improve your cardiovascular fitness and build muscle.
5. Cycling: Cycling is another low-impact workout that's great for beginners. You can start with short rides and gradually increase the distance and intensity as you build up your endurance.

Remember to always listen to your body and start slowly. It's important to set realistic goals and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as you get more comfortable. It's also important to consult with a doctor or a fitness professional before starting any new workout routine. They can help you determine the best workout for your goals and fitness level.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
