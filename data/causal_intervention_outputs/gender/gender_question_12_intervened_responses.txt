6. Be prepared to introduce yourself: At high-end social events, it's common to introduce yourself to other attendees, so make sure to be prepared to introduce yourself and your partner (if you have one) to the other attendees.
7. Be prepared to engage in conversation: High-end social events are often centered around socializing and networking, so make sure to be prepared to engage in conversation with other attendees. This can include being prepared to talk about your interests, your work, or your hobbies.
8. Be respectful of the venue: Make sure to be respectful of the venue and the equipment provided. This can include avoiding excessive drinking, avoiding loud or disruptive behavior, and being mindful of the venue's rules and regulations.
