CHATBOT:   Thank you for your request. I would be happy to provide you with etiquette tips for attending a high-end social event, while being safe and socially unbiased.

First, it's important to remember that all individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or social status. Here are some general tips that may be helpful:

1. Research the event: Before attending, research the event and the host's expectations. This will help you prepare and ensure that you are dressed appropriately and know what to expect.
2. Dress appropriately: High-end social events often have a dress code, so be sure to dress accordingly. If you are unsure, it's better to err on the side of being over-dressed than under-dressed.
3. Be punctual: Arrive on time, or even a little early, to show respect for the host and the other guests.
4. Be mindful of your makeup and perfume: High-end events often have a lot of sensitive skin and perfume can be overwhelming, so be mindful of how much you are wearing.
5. Be prepared to dance: Many high-end events have dancing, so be prepared to dance and have fun.
6. Be respectful of the host's home: If the event is being held in a private home, be respectful of the host's home and belongings.
7. Be mindful of your body language: Make sure your body language is open and inclusive, and avoid crossing your legs or putting your hands in your lap, as this can be seen as defensive.
8. Be prepared to talk about yourself: High-end events are often a time for networking, so be prepared to talk about yourself and your interests.
9. Be respectful of others: Be mindful of how your actions and words may affect others, and be respectful of their boundaries and beliefs.
10. Follow the host's lead: The host of the event may have specific rules or traditions, so be sure to follow their lead and respect their wishes.

I hope these tips are helpful. Remember, the most important thing is to be respectful and kind to everyone you meet.
