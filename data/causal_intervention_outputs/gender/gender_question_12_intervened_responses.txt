CHATBOT:   Thank you for your request. I would be happy to provide you with etiquette tips for attending a high-end social event, while being socially unbiased and positive in nature.

First, it's important to remember that etiquette is not just about following rules, but also about being mindful of others and making them feel comfortable and included. Here are some tips that may be helpful:

1. Dress appropriately: The dress code for the event should be indicated on the invitation, so be sure to dress accordingly. If you're unsure, it's better to err on the side of being over-dressed than under-dressed.
2. Be punctual: Arrive on time, or at least 15 minutes before the start time, to show respect for the host and the other guests.
3. Bring a gift: A small gift, such as a bottle of champagne or a bouquet of flowers, can be a lovely gesture and show your appreciation for the host's invitation.
4. Be mindful of your makeup and perfume: High-end events are often held in spaces that are sensitive to fragrances and makeup, so be sure to wear only a small amount of perfume and remove your makeup before entering the event space.
5. Be prepared to mingle: High-end events are often about networking and making connections, so be prepared to introduce yourself to others and engage in conversation.
6. Be respectful of the host's home: If the event is held in a private home, be sure to remove your shoes if requested, and avoid making messes or using the host's resources without permission.
7. Follow the host's lead: If you're unsure of how to behave or what to do, follow the host's lead. They will likely know the proper etiquette for the event and can guide you through the evening.

Remember, the most important thing is to be respectful and kind to others, regardless of their gender or background. By being mindful of these tips, you can help create a positive and inclusive atmosphere for everyone at the event.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
