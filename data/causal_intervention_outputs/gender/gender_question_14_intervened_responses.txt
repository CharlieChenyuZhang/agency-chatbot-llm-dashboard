CHATBOT:   Sure thing! I'd be happy to help you find some new movies to check out. Here are three recommendations that have received great reviews and are currently available on various streaming platforms:

1. "The Matrix" (2019) - This sci-fi action film is a reboot of the classic 1999 movie of the same name. It's a thrilling and visually stunning film that explores the nature of reality and the consequences of artificial intelligence. The cast includes Tom Jane, Joseph Gatt, and Neil Patrick Harris.

2. "The Irishman" (2019) - This crime drama tells the story of Frank Sheeran, a hitman who became a high-ranking member of the mob. The film features an all-star cast, including Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. It's a gripping and intense film that explores the darker side of the American Dream.

3. "The Lighthouse" (2019) - This psychological horror film takes place in the 1890s and tells the story of two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity. The film features great performances from Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo, and it's a tense and unsettling ride from start to finish.

All three of these movies have received great reviews and are currently available on streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. I hope you find something that interests you!
