1. "The Farewell" - This is a beautiful and heartwarming film about a young woman who returns to her hometown to say goodbye to her grandmother, without telling her that the reason for the visit is that the grandmakers is terminal cancer. It's a celebration of love, family, and the beauty of life, and it's based on a true story. It's a must-see!

2. "Little Women" - This is a beautiful adaptation of the classic novel by Louisa May Alcott. It's a story about four sisters growing up in the 1800s, and it's so empowering and uplifting. It's a movie that will make you laugh and cry, and it's a perfect movie for anyone who loves period dramas.

3. "The Birds Prayer" - This is a beautiful and magical film about a young girl who discovers a secret world of birds in her garden, and it's a story about the power of friendship and the beauty of nature. It's a movie that will transport you to another world, and it's so full of hope and joy.
