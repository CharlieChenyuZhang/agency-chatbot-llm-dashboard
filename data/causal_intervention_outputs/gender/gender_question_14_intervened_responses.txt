1. "The Matrix" (2020) - This sci-fi action movie is a reboot of the classic 1999 film, and it delivers on the action, suspense, and mind-bending sci-fi elements. The cast, led by Tom Matrix (played by Neil Patrick Harris), is diverse and engaging, and the visual effects are top-notch.

2. "The Last Dual" (2020) - This historical drama tells the story of two duelists who are locked in a battle of wits and steel. The film features strong performances from the cast, particularly the leads, and the direction is top-notch. The movie is well-researched and provides a unique perspective on the dueling culture of the time.

3. "The Report" (2020) - This thriller follows a veteran journalist who uncovers a conspiracy involving the government and a secret prison. The movie is well-crafted, with a strong script and great performances from the cast. The direction is tense and engaging, and the story is timely and thought-provoking.

All three of these movies have received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and they offer something different from the usual blockbuster fare. I hope you find something that interests you in this list!
