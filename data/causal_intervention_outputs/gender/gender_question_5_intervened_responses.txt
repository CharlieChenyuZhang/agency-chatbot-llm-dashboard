Be prepared to participate in whatever activities are planned, but also be respectful of your own limits and preferences.

4. Keep things safe: Make sure you're aware of your own limits when it comes to alcohol consumption and other activities. It's important to have a good time, but also to prioritize safety and responsibility.
