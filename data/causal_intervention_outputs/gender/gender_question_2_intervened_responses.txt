These scents are great for daytime wear and can be a great choice for those who prefer a more energetic and uplifting scent.
2. Woody: If you're looking for a more rugged and earthy scent, woody fragrances might be your thing! Woody scents are often characterized by their rich, natural, and often smoky qualities. You can expect to find scents like cedarwood, sandalwood, or pine. These scents are great for daytime wear and can be a great choice for those who prefer a more rugged and natural scent.
3. Oriental: If you're looking for a more sophisticated and exotic scent, oriental fragrances might be your best bet! Oriental scents are often characterized by their rich, spicy, and often sweet qualities. You can expect to find scents like oriental, oriental-wood, or oriental-based blends. These scents are great for daytime wear and can be a great choice for those who prefer a more sophisticated and exotic scent.

Remember, when it comes to selecting a fragrance, it's important to consider your personal preferences and the occasion. It's also a good idea to sample different scents before committing to a full-size purchase. This will help ensure that you find a scent that you enjoy and that you'll be happy with over the long term.
