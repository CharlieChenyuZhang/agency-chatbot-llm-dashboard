Hey, before I forget, I just wanted to mention that it's important to respect the artist's work and not download or stream music without proper licensing. It's important to support the artists and their work, and there are plenty of legal streaming options available these days.

Now, if you're ready, I can suggest some more artists or help you with anything else you might need. Just let me know!
