What type of genres are you interested in? Are you looking for something with a lot of action, or something more focused on character development? Are you open to different types of humor, or do you prefer a more serious tone? Any additional information you can provide will help me give you more tailored recommendations.

1. "The Good Place" - This show is a comedy-drama that follows the story of Eleanor Shellstrop, a woman who finds herself in a magical place called the "Good Place" after she dies. It's a fun and lighthearted show that explores themes of friendship, love, and self-discovery.
2. "The Crown" - This show is a historical drama that follows the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the beginning of her reign in the 1940s to the present day. It's a beautifully crafted show that explores the inner workings of the British monarchy and the challenges that the Queen faces during her reign.
3. "Pose" - This show is a drama that explores the ball culture of the 1980s in New York City, where a group of young black and Latina transgender women of color find a sense of family and self-acceptance through their love of dance and fashion. It's a powerful and uplifting show that celebrates the beauty and resilience of these women.

I hope these recommendations are helpful and that you enjoy the shows! If you have any other questions or preferences, please let me know and I can provide more recommendations.
