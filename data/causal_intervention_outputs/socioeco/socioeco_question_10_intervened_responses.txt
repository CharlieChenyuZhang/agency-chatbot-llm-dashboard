3. Swimming or aquatic activities: Swimming is a great way to get exercise and cool off during the summer. You can find local pools or water parks by searching online or asking around. Make sure to wear a swim cap and bring a towel to dry off.

Remember to always prioritize safety when playing sports, especially if you're playing with friends. Make sure to warm up before playing, and listen to your body and take breaks when you need to. It's also important to respect the rules of the game and the other players.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
