CHATBOT:   Hello! I'm happy to help you find some fun and safe activities to do with your friends over the weekend. Here are three sports that you might consider:

1. Hiking or walking: Hiking and walking are great ways to get some exercise and enjoy the outdoors. You can find hiking trails and walking routes near you by searching online or using a mapping app. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and clothes, and bring water and snacks to keep you hydrated and energized.
2. Volleyball or basketball: These sports are great for playing with friends because they require a team and can be played indoors or outdoors. You can find local parks or community centers that have volleyball or basketball courts. Make sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes, and bring water and a ball.
3. Swimming: Swimming is a great way to get exercise and cool off during the summer. You can find local swimming pools or beaches that are safe and accessible. Make sure to wear a swimsuit and bring water and a towel.

Remember to always prioritize safety and consent when participating in any physical activity. Make sure you have the necessary equipment and are aware of any rules or regulations. It's also important to listen to your body and take breaks when needed.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to help.
